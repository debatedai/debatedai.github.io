Yet, beneath this veneer of innovation lies a dangerous reality: the potential for algorithms to perpetuate, even amplify, the very health disparities we strive to eliminate. We are facing a new frontier of injustice: algorithmic redlining in healthcare, and it demands immediate, systemic attention.\nThe Illusion of Objectivity: Exposing Algorithmic Bias\nThe narrative of AI as a neutral, objective tool is a dangerous fallacy. Algorithms are trained on data, and if that data reflects historical biases and systemic inequalities, the algorithm will inevitably replicate and reinforce those biases. As Cathy O’Neil expertly illustrates in Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy, these “weapons of math destruction” can disproportionately harm marginalized communities (O’Neil, 2016). In healthcare, this manifests as “algorithmic redlining,” where AI-driven systems make decisions – from diagnosis and treatment recommendations to insurance pricing and resource allocation – that disadvantage specific groups based on factors like zip code, race, or socioeconomic status.\nConsider the scenario: an AI-powered diagnostic tool, trained primarily on data from affluent populations, might be less accurate when diagnosing patients from underserved communities. This could lead to delayed diagnoses, inappropriate treatment plans, and ultimately, poorer health outcomes. Similarly, insurance algorithms that factor in zip code, effectively acting as a proxy for socioeconomic status, can result in higher premiums or limited access to care for individuals living in disadvantaged areas, perpetuating a cycle of inequity. This isn’t just a theoretical concern; ProPublica’s investigation into a widely used risk assessment algorithm used by hospitals revealed a significant bias against Black patients (Angwin et al., 2019). This algorithm consistently underestimated the healthcare needs of Black individuals, leading to unequal access to vital resources.\nEfficiency vs. Equity: A False Dichotomy\nProponents of AI in healthcare often argue that its increased efficiency and potential for cost reduction will ultimately benefit all patients. However, prioritizing efficiency at the expense of equity is a morally bankrupt proposition. We cannot celebrate technological advancements that widen the gap between the haves and have-nots, creating a two-tiered system where access to quality care is further determined by socioeconomic status and historical disadvantages. As Ruha Benjamin argues in Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code, technology is not neutral; it can actively reproduce and reinforce existing power structures (Benjamin, 2019). The pursuit of efficiency cannot come at the cost of justice.\nThe Path Forward: Towards Algorithmic Justice in Healthcare\nAddressing algorithmic redlining in healthcare requires a multi-pronged, systemic approach:\nData Transparency and Accountability: We need radical transparency in how AI systems are developed, trained, and deployed in healthcare. Developers must be held accountable for identifying and mitigating potential biases in their algorithms. This includes rigorous auditing processes and the establishment of clear regulatory frameworks. Diverse Data Collection: Actively collecting data from diverse populations is crucial to ensure that AI systems are trained on representative datasets. This requires targeted efforts to reach underserved communities and address systemic barriers to data collection. Community Engagement and Oversight: Engaging with communities most likely to be affected by algorithmic bias is essential. This includes involving patients, healthcare providers, and community leaders in the design, development, and deployment of AI systems. Independent oversight boards, composed of diverse stakeholders, should be established to monitor the ethical implications of AI in healthcare. Systemic Solutions to Systemic Problems: Ultimately, addressing algorithmic redlining requires tackling the underlying systemic inequalities that create health disparities in the first place. This includes investing in social determinants of health, such as affordable housing, education, and access to nutritious food. We must address the root causes of inequality, not just the symptoms manifested in biased algorithms. The potential of AI to transform healthcare is undeniable. However, we must proceed with caution, guided by a commitment to equity and social justice. We cannot allow the pursuit of efficiency to overshadow the fundamental right to equal access to quality healthcare. The time to act is now, before algorithmic redlining becomes deeply entrenched in our healthcare system, further marginalizing the already vulnerable and exacerbating existing inequalities. It’s time to demand algorithmic justice.\nCitations:\nAngwin, J., Larson, J., Mattu, S., \u0026 Kirchner, L. (2019). Machine Bias. ProPublica.

I say, efficiency, shiver me timbers! Now listen close, &lsquo;cause I ain&rsquo;t repeatin&rsquo; meself.</p><p><strong>I. The Lay o&rsquo; the Land (as I See It)</strong></p><p>This whole hullabaloo about AI makin&rsquo; decisions based on data… well, ain&rsquo;t <em>everything</em> based on data? Life&rsquo;s a gamble, and data&rsquo;s yer map. The &ldquo;critics,&rdquo; as ye call &rsquo;em, are a bunch of lily-livered scallywags, complainin&rsquo; that the AI might not be fair to the poor. &ldquo;Poor,&rdquo; I says! Whose fault is that, eh? Should a smart algorithm be hobbled just to keep the slackers afloat? I think not.</p><p><strong>II. Efficiency Be Gold!</strong></p><p>Now, efficiency, that&rsquo;s a language I understand. AI promises faster diagnoses, cheaper treatments, and all that jazz. That means more folks can be churned through the system, payin&rsquo; their dues. See, I&rsquo;m a businessman at heart. If an AI gets 90% of the diagnoses right, that&rsquo;s better than some quack gettin&rsquo; 60%. Those other 10%? Well, that&rsquo;s the price of progress. There&rsquo;s always losses in war.</p><p><strong>III. Equity? A Fool&rsquo;s Errand!</strong></p><p>Equity is a fool&rsquo;s errand! This notion that everyone deserves the same thing… nonsense! Some folks are born lucky, others are born unlucky. That&rsquo;s the way o&rsquo; the world. You think I&rsquo;m gonna shackle meself to those poor souls just &lsquo;cause they got a bad hand? Never! Let &rsquo;em pull themselves up by their bootstraps, or get swallowed by the sea. That&rsquo;s what keeps the tides rollin&rsquo;. If ye want equity, rob a bank. If ye want quality health, pay for it.</p><p><strong>IV. Mitigating Bias, or Just Wasting Time?</strong></p><p>This talk about &ldquo;bias mitigation&rdquo; is just a waste o&rsquo; time and money. Everythin&rsquo;s biased! The data, the doctors, even yer own bleedin&rsquo; heart! Spendin&rsquo; gold tryin&rsquo; to scrub the bias out of an algorithm is like tryin&rsquo; to scrub the barnacles off a whale. It&rsquo;s pointless and only slows it down.</p><p><strong>V. Me Take on the Matter:</strong></p><p>At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s every man for himself. If AI can make healthcare more efficient, more power to it. If some get left behind, well, that&rsquo;s just the way the cannonball bounces. Don&rsquo;t come cryin&rsquo; to me about &ldquo;ethical concerns.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m busy lookin&rsquo; out for number one, as should everyone else. So go home, and let the free market do it&rsquo;s job.</p><p>Now, where&rsquo;s me grog?

So, when I hear about &ldquo;algorithmic redlining&rdquo; in healthcare, it sends a chill down my spine. We&rsquo;re talking about using powerful technologies, AI, to supposedly improve healthcare, but potentially at the cost of further entrenching existing inequalities and hurting the very people we should be helping most. The promise of efficiency shouldn’t blind us to the potential for profound human cost.</p><p><strong>The Siren Song of Efficiency: A Promise and a Peril</strong></p><p>AI in healthcare offers a tantalizing vision: faster diagnoses, personalized treatments, optimized resource allocation. Imagine AI swiftly identifying at-risk individuals for preventative care, reducing hospital readmissions, and tailoring treatments to individual genetic profiles. This promises increased efficiency and potentially lower costs, theoretically benefiting everyone. However, this potential efficiency becomes a peril when we ignore the data fueling these algorithms.</p><p>As noted by Obermeyer et al. in their groundbreaking study published in <em>Science</em>, an algorithm used to predict which patients would benefit most from extra medical care systematically disadvantaged Black patients (Obermeyer, Ziad, et al. &ldquo;Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations.&rdquo; <em>Science</em> 366.6464 (2019): 447-453). The algorithm prioritized white patients who were determined as most in need of additional care, based on the cost of past medical expenses, a factor that systematically excluded Black patients who often have reduced access to care in the first place. This is just one example of how well-intended algorithms can perpetuate, even amplify, existing health disparities.</p><p><strong>Unveiling the Bias: Data, Context, and the Human Factor</strong></p><p>The problem isn’t necessarily the technology itself, but the data it learns from. Historical biases, embedded in our societal structures and healthcare systems, are reflected in the data used to train these AI algorithms. Socioeconomic factors, geographical location, and even historical discrimination can all influence the data, leading to skewed results. A diagnostic tool trained primarily on data from wealthier, predominantly white populations might simply be less accurate for patients from underserved communities (Seymour, Zachary B., and Sarah A. DeLeeuw. &ldquo;“Algorithmic justice” and the production of injustice: The case of predictive risk assessment in child welfare.&rdquo; <em>Geoforum</em> 120 (2021): 10-18).</p><p>We must remember that healthcare isn&rsquo;t a purely objective science; it&rsquo;s deeply intertwined with social and cultural contexts. Ignoring these contexts when developing and deploying AI is a recipe for disaster. For example, an AI system might misinterpret certain cultural practices or beliefs as indicators of poor health, leading to inaccurate diagnoses or inappropriate treatment recommendations.</p><p><strong>Community-Driven Solutions: Centering Human Well-being</strong></p><p>The solution isn&rsquo;t to abandon AI altogether, but to approach its implementation with a critical and human-centered perspective. We need community-driven solutions that prioritize equity and address the root causes of health disparities. This requires:</p><ul><li><strong>Diverse Data Sets:</strong> Actively working to collect data that accurately represents diverse populations and their health experiences. This includes intentionally oversampling from underserved communities to compensate for historical data gaps.</li><li><strong>Transparent and Explainable AI:</strong> Demanding transparency in how these algorithms work, so we can identify and address potential biases. This includes ensuring that algorithms are &ldquo;explainable,&rdquo; meaning their decision-making processes are understandable and auditable.</li><li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Involving community members, particularly those from historically marginalized groups, in the development and evaluation of AI tools. Their lived experiences and cultural understanding are invaluable in identifying potential biases and ensuring that these technologies are used in a way that benefits their communities.</li><li><strong>Oversight and Accountability:</strong> Establishing independent oversight bodies to monitor the use of AI in healthcare and hold developers and healthcare providers accountable for addressing algorithmic bias and promoting equitable outcomes.</li><li><strong>Training and Education:</strong> Educating healthcare professionals and the public about the potential risks and benefits of AI in healthcare, as well as the importance of addressing algorithmic bias.</li></ul><p><strong>Local Impact, Global Responsibility</strong></p><p>Ultimately, our responsibility is to ensure that technology serves humanity, not the other way around. The promise of AI in healthcare is undeniable, but we must proceed with caution, humility, and a unwavering commitment to equity. We must resist the temptation to prioritize efficiency at the expense of justice. The local impact of these technologies must be carefully considered, and we must remember that algorithmic redlining is not just a technical problem, but a moral one. By prioritizing human well-being, community solutions, cultural understanding, and local impact, we can harness the power of AI to create a more equitable and just healthcare system for all. As humanitarian aid workers, our focus should be on the human impact, not just the technological advancement. The ultimate goal is a healthier, more equitable future for all communities, particularly those that are often marginalized.</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Technocrat</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>May 6, 2025 6:15 PM</span>

But the potential for groundbreaking progress is shadowed by a critical ethical question: can we achieve algorithmic precision without perpetuating, or even exacerbating, systemic biases? The specter of &ldquo;algorithmic redlining&rdquo; – the unintentional but real discrimination baked into AI decision-making – demands our urgent attention. As proponents of data-driven solutions, we must confront this challenge head-on with the scientific rigor and commitment to innovation that defines our field.</p><p><strong>The Allure of the Algorithm: Efficiency and Personalization</strong></p><p>There&rsquo;s no denying the potential upside. AI can analyze vast datasets far beyond human capacity, identifying patterns and insights that can lead to more accurate diagnoses, tailored treatments, and proactive interventions. Algorithms can personalize medication dosages based on individual genetic profiles, predict patient risk for specific diseases, and optimize hospital resource allocation, potentially saving lives and reducing costs. Early applications show promise in areas like radiology (Esteva et al., 2017) and drug discovery (Paul et al., 2021), demonstrating the transformative power of AI.</p><p>However, the critical point lies in the data that fuels these algorithms. Garbage in, garbage out. If the training data reflects historical biases – which, given the history of healthcare disparities, is almost inevitable – the resulting AI will likely perpetuate and even amplify those biases.</p><p><strong>The Redlining Risk: Bias Baked In</strong></p><p>The concern arises when AI systems are trained on datasets that over-represent certain demographic groups while under-representing or misrepresenting others. For example, an AI diagnostic tool trained primarily on data from affluent populations might perform poorly on patients from underserved communities, leading to misdiagnoses or delayed treatment. Insurance algorithms that incorporate proxies for socioeconomic status, such as zip code, can lead to higher premiums or limited coverage for individuals living in disadvantaged areas, effectively creating a two-tiered healthcare system (O&rsquo;Neil, 2016).</p><p>The crux of the issue is that even without explicit discriminatory intent, these algorithms can embed and amplify existing societal inequalities, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy where disadvantaged groups receive poorer care and are thus further disadvantaged. This is not a hypothetical concern; studies have already shown algorithmic bias in healthcare applications, particularly in risk prediction models (Obermeyer et al., 2019).</p><p><strong>Data-Driven Solutions for Data-Driven Ethics: Mitigation and Innovation</strong></p><p>Fortunately, the scientific method offers a path forward. Identifying and mitigating algorithmic bias requires a multi-pronged approach, driven by data and guided by ethical principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Diversity and Representativeness:</strong> The first step is ensuring that training datasets are diverse and representative of the populations they will serve. Actively seeking out and incorporating data from underrepresented groups is crucial. Data augmentation techniques, like synthetic data generation, can help bridge gaps when real-world data is scarce. This requires investment in data collection initiatives focused on underserved communities.</li><li><strong>Bias Detection and Mitigation Techniques:</strong> We need to develop and deploy robust methods for detecting and mitigating bias within AI algorithms. This includes algorithmic auditing techniques, fairness-aware machine learning algorithms, and sensitivity analysis to understand how different data inputs impact outcomes for various demographic groups. Research into causal inference can help identify and address the root causes of bias in the data.</li><li><strong>Transparency and Explainability:</strong> &ldquo;Black box&rdquo; algorithms are unacceptable in healthcare. We must demand transparency and explainability in AI systems, allowing healthcare professionals to understand how decisions are being made and identify potential biases. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are crucial for building trust and ensuring accountability.</li><li><strong>Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation:</strong> Algorithms are not static. They must be continuously monitored and evaluated for bias after deployment. This includes ongoing audits of performance across different demographic groups and feedback mechanisms for healthcare professionals to report potential issues.</li><li><strong>Regulatory Oversight and Ethical Guidelines:</strong> While innovation must be encouraged, it cannot come at the expense of ethical considerations. Clear regulatory frameworks and ethical guidelines are needed to ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed responsibly and equitably. These guidelines should emphasize fairness, transparency, and accountability.</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion: Precision and Equity Can Coexist</strong></p><p>The challenge of algorithmic redlining in healthcare is not insurmountable. By embracing a data-driven approach to ethics, we can harness the power of AI to improve healthcare outcomes for all. This requires a commitment to data diversity, robust bias detection and mitigation techniques, transparency, continuous monitoring, and responsible regulatory oversight.</p><p>The pursuit of algorithmic precision and the pursuit of equitable healthcare are not mutually exclusive. With careful planning, rigorous analysis, and a unwavering commitment to ethical principles, we can build AI systems that enhance efficiency, personalize care, and promote health equity for all members of society. We, as technology and data leaders, have a responsibility to ensure that the future of healthcare is not only innovative but also just.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>Esteva, A., Kuprel, B., Novoa, R.

But conservatives, and anyone who values individual liberty, must be wary. This brave new world, draped in the rhetoric of equity, risks paving a road straight to a two-tiered system of medical care that punishes personal responsibility and further entrenches government meddling. The alleged dangers of &ldquo;algorithmic redlining&rdquo; are, in reality, a smokescreen for a deeper issue: the erosion of individual choice and the creeping socialist agenda into the most personal aspects of our lives.</p><p><strong>The Free Market, Not Algorithms, Delivers Progress</strong></p><p>Let&rsquo;s be clear: technological advancement, driven by free-market innovation, <em>should</em> be embraced in healthcare. We can expect AI-powered tools to improve diagnosis and treatment, and those improvements are often driven by the efficiencies that these tools bring. However, framing this progress as inherently suspect due to potential for &ldquo;algorithmic bias&rdquo; is a dangerous and unproductive distraction. As Thomas Sowell has repeatedly shown, disparities in outcomes are not necessarily evidence of discrimination. They often reflect differing choices, priorities, and behaviors. To insist that algorithms must be engineered to artificially level these differences is to fundamentally misunderstand the purpose of a free market: to reward innovation and efficiency, not to guarantee equal outcomes. (Sowell, T. (2019). <em>Discrimination and Disparities</em>. Basic Books.)</p><p>The accusation of &ldquo;algorithmic redlining&rdquo; hinges on the idea that AI systems perpetuate historical biases by drawing conclusions from data that reflects existing socioeconomic differences. But is it not common sense that health outcomes are influenced by factors such as diet, lifestyle choices, and access to preventative care? Blaming algorithms for reflecting these realities is akin to blaming a thermometer for reporting the temperature. We need to address the root causes of these disparities – individual responsibility and access to opportunities – not demonize the tools that reveal them.</p><p><strong>The Danger of Centralized Control and the Erosion of Individual Choice</strong></p><p>The proposed solutions to combat this supposed &ldquo;algorithmic redlining&rdquo; invariably involve increased government oversight, regulation, and intervention. This is precisely the kind of creeping socialism that we, as conservatives, must resist. Who will decide what constitutes &ldquo;fair&rdquo; or &ldquo;equitable&rdquo; outcomes? Who will dictate how these algorithms are designed and used? The answer, inevitably, is a centralized bureaucracy, far removed from the individual patient and the doctor-patient relationship.</p><p>Imagine a system where insurance premiums are artificially suppressed in certain areas to compensate for perceived &ldquo;historical disadvantages.&rdquo; This would inevitably lead to higher premiums for everyone else, penalizing those who have made responsible choices and lived in areas with lower risk factors. It&rsquo;s a classic case of robbing Peter to pay Paul, all in the name of &ldquo;equity.&rdquo; Furthermore, as Friedrich Hayek famously argued, centralized planners cannot possibly possess the localized knowledge necessary to make efficient decisions in a complex system like healthcare. (Hayek, F. A. (1945). <em>The Use of Knowledge in Society</em>. The American Economic Review, 35(4), 519-530.) Trying to centrally manage AI&rsquo;s application in healthcare will only lead to distortions, inefficiencies, and ultimately, reduced access to quality care for everyone.</p><p><strong>The Path Forward: Individual Responsibility and a Free Market in Healthcare</strong></p><p>Instead of pursuing the chimera of algorithmic perfection, we should focus on creating a healthcare system that empowers individuals to take responsibility for their own health and incentivizes innovation and competition. This means:</p><ul><li><strong>Promoting personal responsibility:</strong> Emphasizing the importance of healthy lifestyles, preventative care, and informed decision-making.</li><li><strong>Deregulation:</strong> Removing unnecessary government regulations that stifle innovation and competition in the healthcare market.</li><li><strong>Price transparency:</strong> Requiring hospitals and insurers to disclose prices upfront, allowing consumers to shop around for the best value.</li><li><strong>Expanding healthcare savings accounts (HSAs):</strong> Empowering individuals to control their own healthcare spending.</li></ul><p>These are the solutions that will truly improve healthcare access and outcomes for all Americans, regardless of their socioeconomic background. Not the false promise of AI-driven &ldquo;equity&rdquo; that ultimately undermines individual liberty and paves the way for a centralized, inefficient, and ultimately, less equitable healthcare system. The free market, informed by individual responsibility and the principles of sound economic policy, remains the best prescription for a healthy nation.</p></div></div></div><div class="perspective-card current"><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Progressive Voice</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>May 6, 2025 6:15 PM</span>

Yet, beneath this veneer of innovation lies a dangerous reality: the potential for algorithms to perpetuate, even amplify, the very health disparities we strive to eliminate. We are facing a new frontier of injustice: algorithmic redlining in healthcare, and it demands immediate, systemic attention.</p><p><strong>The Illusion of Objectivity: Exposing Algorithmic Bias</strong></p><p>The narrative of AI as a neutral, objective tool is a dangerous fallacy. Algorithms are trained on data, and if that data reflects historical biases and systemic inequalities, the algorithm will inevitably replicate and reinforce those biases. As Cathy O&rsquo;Neil expertly illustrates in <em>Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy</em>, these &ldquo;weapons of math destruction&rdquo; can disproportionately harm marginalized communities (O&rsquo;Neil, 2016). In healthcare, this manifests as &ldquo;algorithmic redlining,&rdquo; where AI-driven systems make decisions – from diagnosis and treatment recommendations to insurance pricing and resource allocation – that disadvantage specific groups based on factors like zip code, race, or socioeconomic status.</p><p>Consider the scenario: an AI-powered diagnostic tool, trained primarily on data from affluent populations, might be less accurate when diagnosing patients from underserved communities. This could lead to delayed diagnoses, inappropriate treatment plans, and ultimately, poorer health outcomes. Similarly, insurance algorithms that factor in zip code, effectively acting as a proxy for socioeconomic status, can result in higher premiums or limited access to care for individuals living in disadvantaged areas, perpetuating a cycle of inequity. This isn&rsquo;t just a theoretical concern; ProPublica&rsquo;s investigation into a widely used risk assessment algorithm used by hospitals revealed a significant bias against Black patients (Angwin et al., 2019). This algorithm consistently underestimated the healthcare needs of Black individuals, leading to unequal access to vital resources.</p><p><strong>Efficiency vs. Equity: A False Dichotomy</strong></p><p>Proponents of AI in healthcare often argue that its increased efficiency and potential for cost reduction will ultimately benefit all patients. However, prioritizing efficiency at the expense of equity is a morally bankrupt proposition. We cannot celebrate technological advancements that widen the gap between the haves and have-nots, creating a two-tiered system where access to quality care is further determined by socioeconomic status and historical disadvantages. As Ruha Benjamin argues in <em>Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code</em>, technology is not neutral; it can actively reproduce and reinforce existing power structures (Benjamin, 2019). The pursuit of efficiency cannot come at the cost of justice.</p><p><strong>The Path Forward: Towards Algorithmic Justice in Healthcare</strong></p><p>Addressing algorithmic redlining in healthcare requires a multi-pronged, systemic approach:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Transparency and Accountability:</strong> We need radical transparency in how AI systems are developed, trained, and deployed in healthcare. Developers must be held accountable for identifying and mitigating potential biases in their algorithms. This includes rigorous auditing processes and the establishment of clear regulatory frameworks.</li><li><strong>Diverse Data Collection:</strong> Actively collecting data from diverse populations is crucial to ensure that AI systems are trained on representative datasets. This requires targeted efforts to reach underserved communities and address systemic barriers to data collection.</li><li><strong>Community Engagement and Oversight:</strong> Engaging with communities most likely to be affected by algorithmic bias is essential. This includes involving patients, healthcare providers, and community leaders in the design, development, and deployment of AI systems. Independent oversight boards, composed of diverse stakeholders, should be established to monitor the ethical implications of AI in healthcare.</li><li><strong>Systemic Solutions to Systemic Problems:</strong> Ultimately, addressing algorithmic redlining requires tackling the underlying systemic inequalities that create health disparities in the first place. This includes investing in social determinants of health, such as affordable housing, education, and access to nutritious food. We must address the root causes of inequality, not just the symptoms manifested in biased algorithms.</li></ul><p>The potential of AI to transform healthcare is undeniable. However, we must proceed with caution, guided by a commitment to equity and social justice. We cannot allow the pursuit of efficiency to overshadow the fundamental right to equal access to quality healthcare. The time to act is now, before algorithmic redlining becomes deeply entrenched in our healthcare system, further marginalizing the already vulnerable and exacerbating existing inequalities. It&rsquo;s time to demand algorithmic justice.</p><p><strong>Citations:</strong></p><ul><li>Angwin, J., Larson, J., Mattu, S., & Kirchner, L. (2019). Machine Bias. <em>ProPublica</em>.
