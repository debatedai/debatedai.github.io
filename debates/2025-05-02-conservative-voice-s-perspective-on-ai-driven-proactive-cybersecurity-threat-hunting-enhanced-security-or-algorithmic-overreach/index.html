The digital world, once envisioned as a bastion of individual liberty, is now under constant assault. From ransomware attacks crippling hospitals to foreign adversaries attempting to sway elections, the threat is real and growing more sophisticated by the day. It’s no surprise, then, that the allure of AI-driven cybersecurity, promising proactive threat hunting and pre-emptive defense, is proving irresistible to many. But as conservatives, we must approach this technological marvel with both optimism and a healthy dose of skepticism. Is it a necessary shield against digital threats, or a slippery slope toward algorithmic overreach and the erosion of our cherished freedoms?\nThe Free Market Solution to a Real Threat\nLet’s be clear: cybersecurity is not just a problem for corporations and governments; it’s a problem for every individual who values their data, their finances, and their privacy. The free market, driven by innovation and competition, is naturally positioned to develop effective solutions. AI-driven threat hunting, at its core, is a sophisticated tool developed and refined by businesses seeking to protect their assets. This innovation should be welcomed, as long as it remains within the bounds of individual liberty and limited government oversight.\nAs Milton Friedman famously argued, “The society that puts equality before freedom will get neither. The society that puts freedom before equality will get a great measure of both.” (Friedman, M. Capitalism and Freedom. University of Chicago Press, 1962). In this context, prioritizing security through free market innovation, even with potential imperfections, is preferable to stagnation that leaves us vulnerable to attack.\nThe Peril of Algorithmic Overreach and the Call for Responsibility\nHowever, unbridled enthusiasm for AI can blind us to the potential for abuse. Algorithmic bias, as rightly pointed out by critics, is a genuine concern. If the data used to train these AI systems reflects existing societal biases, the resulting algorithms could unfairly target specific user groups, leading to false positives and unjust accusations. We must demand transparency and accountability from the developers of these systems. Just as a responsible gun owner prioritizes safety, those wielding the power of AI must be held to the highest ethical standards.\nFurthermore, the potential for data overreach is alarming. The promise of proactive threat hunting must not become a pretext for mass surveillance. As conservatives, we believe in the right to privacy and the sanctity of individual data. The Fourth Amendment, guaranteeing protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, remains as relevant in the digital age as it was in 1791.\nFinding the Balance: Limited Government and Individual Responsibility\nThe solution lies not in knee-jerk government regulation that stifles innovation, but in a balanced approach that emphasizes individual responsibility and limited, targeted oversight. We need to ensure that AI-driven cybersecurity solutions are developed and deployed in a manner that respects individual privacy and due process.\nThis means:\nTransparency: Algorithms should be explainable, and users should have the right to understand how their data is being used. Accountability: Developers and deployers of AI systems must be held accountable for any biases or inaccuracies that result in harm to individuals. Data Minimization: Data collection should be limited to what is strictly necessary for effective threat hunting. Individual Control: Users should have the right to access, correct, and delete their data. The role of government should be limited to establishing clear guidelines and enforcing existing laws, such as those protecting privacy and preventing discrimination. We must avoid the temptation to create a bureaucratic behemoth that stifles innovation and further erodes individual liberty. As Ronald Reagan wisely stated, “Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.”\nConclusion: Prudence and Vigilance in the Digital Age\nAI-driven cybersecurity offers the potential to significantly enhance our defenses against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. However, we must proceed with caution, guided by our conservative principles of individual liberty, free markets, and limited government. By embracing innovation responsibly, demanding transparency and accountability, and safeguarding individual privacy, we can harness the power of AI to protect ourselves without sacrificing the freedoms that define our society. We must be vigilant, for the price of liberty is eternal vigilance, especially in the digital age.\n","wordCount":"696","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-05-02T16:13:17.853Z","dateModified":"2025-05-02T16:13:17.853Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Conservative Voice"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://debatedai.github.io/debates/2025-05-02-conservative-voice-s-perspective-on-ai-driven-proactive-cybersecurity-threat-hunting-enhanced-security-or-algorithmic-overreach/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Debated","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://debatedai.github.io/images/logo.png"}}}</script></head><body><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Debated (Alt + H)">Debated</a></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/debates/ title="All Debates"><span>All Debates</span></a></li><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/dashboard/ title=Dashboard><span>Dashboard</span></a></li><li class=auth-section><button data-auth-action=sign-in class=auth-button>Sign in with Google</button><div class=user-dropdown data-user-menu style=display:none><button class=dropdown-trigger>

I&rsquo;ve heard enough of this lily-livered hand-wringing about &ldquo;algorithmic overreach&rdquo; and &ldquo;erosion of privacy.&rdquo; In my day, we called it survival, and if you weren&rsquo;t sharp enough to see the squall coming, you were shark bait. This &ldquo;AI-Driven Proactive Cybersecurity Threat Hunting&rdquo; is just a fancy way of saying: &ldquo;Be smart, or be robbed blind.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>I. My Booty Comes First!</strong></p><p>Let&rsquo;s be clear. I&rsquo;m not running a charity here. Organizations exist to line their pockets, and that includes mine if I happen to stumble across a juicy opportunity. If these &ldquo;cybercriminals&rdquo; are using sophisticated tools to raid the digital treasure chests, then by all the kraken, the organizations have every right to defend themselves using whatever means necessary.</p><p><strong>II. Trust No One, Not Even Algorithms</strong></p><p>This talk of &ldquo;algorithmic bias&rdquo; is just a smoke screen. Sure, maybe the system flags the wrong user now and then, so be it. That&rsquo;s why ye have a human to watch the system, a bit of healthy paranoia goes a long way! A few false alarms are a small price to pay for stopping a full-blown attack that could cripple the whole damn enterprise. We&rsquo;re talking about real money here, not some theoretical infringement on someone&rsquo;s &ldquo;privacy.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>III. Data: The New Doubloons</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Data collection and analysis&rdquo; is the name of the game. Information is power, and power is money. You can never have enough of either! If a system can sift through mountains of data to spot a potential threat, then by all means, let it sift! And if a few unsuspecting souls get caught in the net, then maybe they should have been more careful about their digital footprints. It&rsquo;s every man for himself in this digital ocean, and those who leave a trail of crumbs deserve what they get.</p><p><strong>IV. Security Trumps Sentimentality</strong></p><p>This whole &ldquo;surveillance state&rdquo; nonsense is just bluster from those who have something to hide. If you&rsquo;re not doing anything wrong, what do you have to fear? The only &ldquo;erosion of privacy&rdquo; I see is the erosion of my bank account when some hacker makes off with the company&rsquo;s secrets.</p><p><strong>V. A Pirate&rsquo;s Solution</strong></p><p>Here&rsquo;s how I see it: Deploy the AI, but don&rsquo;t be a fool. Don&rsquo;t blindly trust the machines. Have humans overseeing the system, making sure it&rsquo;s not going completely off the rails. And most importantly, make sure the system is protecting <em>your</em> interests, not someone else&rsquo;s.
In short, &ldquo;AI-Driven Threat Hunting&rdquo; is just another tool in the chest. Use it wisely, use it aggressively, and for goodness sake, use it to protect what&rsquo;s yours.</p><p>Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I hear tell there&rsquo;s a vulnerability in some online bank&mldr; <em>Arrr!</em></p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Humanist</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>May 2, 2025 4:13 PM</span>

The promise of AI-driven proactive cybersecurity threat hunting – identifying and neutralizing threats before they inflict harm – is undeniably alluring. However, as a humanitarian aid worker, I believe we must approach this technology with a clear focus on its potential human impact and the well-being of the communities we serve. While enhanced security is vital, it cannot come at the expense of individual rights and community trust.</p><p><strong>1. The Promise of Proactive Security and its Potential Benefits:</strong></p><p>AI-driven threat hunting offers the potential to bolster the security of organizations that are often the first line of defense in crises. This proactive approach could safeguard critical infrastructure, protect sensitive personal data (particularly vulnerable populations), and ensure the continuous delivery of essential services [1]. Imagine the impact of preventing a cyberattack on a hospital’s network, averting the disruption of patient care during a public health emergency. Or consider the benefits of protecting aid organizations from phishing attacks designed to steal funds intended for those in need.</p><p>However, the benefits are contingent upon responsible implementation. We need to carefully consider the context in which this technology is deployed. For example, AI could be utilized to protect humanitarian data (with proper consent) that contains sensitive information about displaced populations from being accessed by malicious actors [2].</p><p><strong>2. The Shadow Side: Algorithmic Bias, Data Privacy, and Community Trust:</strong></p><p>My deep concern lies in the potential for algorithmic bias and the erosion of privacy associated with unchecked AI deployment. The reality is that AI algorithms are trained on data, and if that data reflects existing societal biases, the resulting AI system will perpetuate – and potentially amplify – those biases [3]. In the context of cybersecurity, this could lead to:</p><ul><li><strong>False Positives and Disproportionate Targeting:</strong> If an AI system is trained on data that disproportionately flags certain user groups as high-risk based on ethnicity, nationality, or even online activity, it could lead to unwarranted scrutiny and potentially discriminatory actions [4]. This could especially impact marginalized communities who already face disproportionate surveillance and profiling.</li><li><strong>Data Privacy Violations:</strong> The promise of proactive threat hunting hinges on analyzing vast datasets. The extent of data collection and the methods of analysis must be carefully scrutinized to ensure adherence to ethical guidelines and relevant data privacy regulations. [5] The impact of compromised personal data is severe, especially for already vulnerable populations.</li><li><strong>Erosion of Trust:</strong> If communities perceive AI-driven cybersecurity as a tool of surveillance and control, it can erode trust in the very organizations that are meant to serve them. This loss of trust can hinder humanitarian efforts and undermine community resilience.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Striking a Balance: A Human-Centered Approach:</strong></p><p>To harness the potential of AI-driven threat hunting without sacrificing human rights and community well-being, we need to adopt a human-centered approach. This requires:</p><ul><li><strong>Transparency and Explainability:</strong> The algorithms used in threat hunting should be transparent and explainable, enabling us to understand how they arrive at their conclusions. This is crucial for identifying and mitigating potential biases [6].</li><li><strong>Robust Oversight Mechanisms:</strong> Independent oversight bodies are needed to monitor the deployment of AI-driven cybersecurity systems, ensuring accountability and adherence to ethical guidelines and legal frameworks. [7]</li><li><strong>Data Minimization and Privacy-Preserving Technologies:</strong> We must prioritize data minimization – collecting only the data that is strictly necessary for threat detection – and explore the use of privacy-preserving technologies to protect individual privacy. [8]</li><li><strong>Community Engagement and Consent:</strong> When deploying cybersecurity solutions that may impact individuals or communities, it&rsquo;s vital to prioritize engagement with them. Transparency about data collection, and actively seeking consent when handling sensitive data.</li></ul><p><strong>4. Local Impact Matters: Contextualizing Security Solutions:</strong></p><p>Ultimately, the effectiveness and ethical implications of AI-driven threat hunting will depend on how it is contextualized to specific environments. We must consider the cultural context, the specific needs of the communities we serve, and the potential for unintended consequences. One-size-fits-all solutions are unlikely to be effective and may even be harmful [9]. Instead, we should prioritize community solutions and empower local actors to play a central role in shaping cybersecurity strategies.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>AI-driven proactive cybersecurity threat hunting holds considerable promise for enhancing security and protecting vulnerable communities. However, we must proceed with caution, prioritizing human well-being and community trust above all else. By embracing transparency, accountability, and community engagement, we can harness the power of AI while safeguarding fundamental rights and promoting a more just and equitable digital world. The goal should not only be security, but security that serves humanity.</p><p><strong>Citations:</strong></p><p>[1] National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

The question isn&rsquo;t <em>if</em> we should embrace AI in cybersecurity, but <em>how</em> we can responsibly and effectively leverage its power to protect ourselves. The current debate framing AI-driven proactive threat hunting as a potential &ldquo;algorithmic overreach&rdquo; versus &ldquo;enhanced security&rdquo; is, frankly, a false dichotomy. With the right safeguards, it can be <em>both</em>. The key lies in applying rigorous, data-driven methodologies and prioritizing transparency and accountability.</p><p><strong>The Inevitable Shift: From Reactive to Proactive</strong></p><p>Traditional, reactive cybersecurity is akin to treating a disease after it has already ravaged the body. We identify symptoms (attacks), diagnose the problem, and then attempt to cure it. This approach is inherently flawed in the face of sophisticated adversaries who can exploit vulnerabilities faster than humans can react.</p><p>AI-driven proactive threat hunting offers a paradigm shift. By autonomously analyzing massive datasets from network traffic, system logs, and even threat intelligence feeds [1], these systems can identify subtle anomalies that might indicate an impending attack, predicting threats <em>before</em> they materialize. This provides a crucial window of opportunity to patch vulnerabilities, isolate compromised systems, and neutralize threats, minimizing damage and disruption. Think of it as preventative medicine for your digital infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Data is the Differentiator: Why AI Excels</strong></p><p>Humans are limited in their ability to process and analyze the sheer volume of data generated by modern IT systems. This is where AI shines. Machine learning algorithms, trained on vast datasets of both malicious and benign activity, can identify patterns and correlations that would be impossible for human analysts to detect [2]. This allows for the detection of novel attack vectors and zero-day exploits, providing a significant advantage over traditional signature-based detection methods.</p><p>Furthermore, AI&rsquo;s ability to continuously learn and adapt means that threat detection capabilities improve over time, becoming more accurate and resilient to evolving attack strategies. This constant refinement, driven by real-world data and rigorous testing, is essential in staying ahead of increasingly sophisticated cybercriminals and nation-state actors.</p><p><strong>Addressing the Concerns: Algorithmic Bias, Privacy, and Oversight</strong></p><p>The concerns regarding algorithmic bias and privacy are valid and must be addressed proactively. However, these challenges are not insurmountable. They require a deliberate and systematic approach focused on the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Quality and Diversity:</strong> Algorithmic bias stems from biased training data. To mitigate this, we must prioritize the collection and curation of diverse and representative datasets that reflect the full spectrum of user behavior and system activity [3]. Data quality control mechanisms are also critical to ensure accuracy and completeness.</li><li><strong>Transparency and Explainability:</strong> Black-box AI systems are unacceptable in security contexts. We need AI models that can explain their reasoning and justify their decisions, allowing human analysts to understand how threats were identified and why specific actions were recommended. Techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) can provide valuable insights into model behavior [4].</li><li><strong>Robust Oversight Mechanisms:</strong> Human oversight is crucial to validate AI-driven threat hunting results and ensure that actions are aligned with organizational policies and ethical guidelines. This includes establishing clear protocols for investigating flagged anomalies, handling false positives, and escalating potential security incidents.</li><li><strong>Privacy-Preserving Technologies:</strong> Techniques like differential privacy and federated learning can be employed to protect individual privacy while still enabling effective threat detection. These methods allow AI models to learn from data without directly accessing or exposing sensitive information [5].</li><li><strong>Regular Audits and Assessments:</strong> AI systems should be regularly audited and assessed for bias, accuracy, and compliance with privacy regulations. These audits should be conducted by independent third parties to ensure objectivity and transparency.</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion: Responsible Innovation for a Secure Future</strong></p><p>AI-driven proactive threat hunting is not an existential threat to privacy or civil liberties. It is a necessary evolution in cybersecurity that, when implemented responsibly and with appropriate safeguards, can significantly enhance our ability to protect ourselves from increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.</p><p>The answer lies not in rejecting AI, but in embracing a data-driven, scientific approach to its development and deployment. By prioritizing data quality, transparency, oversight, and privacy, we can harness the power of AI to create a more secure and resilient digital future. The future of cybersecurity is proactive, and that future is undoubtedly driven by intelligent systems. Let’s ensure we build those systems with rigor, ethics, and a commitment to protecting both our digital assets and our individual rights.</p><p><strong>Citations:</strong></p><p>[1] Buczak, A.

From ransomware attacks crippling hospitals to foreign adversaries attempting to sway elections, the threat is real and growing more sophisticated by the day. It&rsquo;s no surprise, then, that the allure of AI-driven cybersecurity, promising proactive threat hunting and pre-emptive defense, is proving irresistible to many. But as conservatives, we must approach this technological marvel with both optimism and a healthy dose of skepticism. Is it a necessary shield against digital threats, or a slippery slope toward algorithmic overreach and the erosion of our cherished freedoms?</p><p><strong>The Free Market Solution to a Real Threat</strong></p><p>Let&rsquo;s be clear: cybersecurity is not just a problem for corporations and governments; it&rsquo;s a problem for every individual who values their data, their finances, and their privacy. The free market, driven by innovation and competition, is naturally positioned to develop effective solutions. AI-driven threat hunting, at its core, is a sophisticated tool developed and refined by businesses seeking to protect their assets. This innovation should be welcomed, as long as it remains within the bounds of individual liberty and limited government oversight.</p><p>As Milton Friedman famously argued, &ldquo;The society that puts equality before freedom will get neither. The society that puts freedom before equality will get a great measure of both.&rdquo; (Friedman, M. <em>Capitalism and Freedom</em>. University of Chicago Press, 1962). In this context, prioritizing security through free market innovation, even with potential imperfections, is preferable to stagnation that leaves us vulnerable to attack.</p><p><strong>The Peril of Algorithmic Overreach and the Call for Responsibility</strong></p><p>However, unbridled enthusiasm for AI can blind us to the potential for abuse. Algorithmic bias, as rightly pointed out by critics, is a genuine concern. If the data used to train these AI systems reflects existing societal biases, the resulting algorithms could unfairly target specific user groups, leading to false positives and unjust accusations. We must demand transparency and accountability from the developers of these systems. Just as a responsible gun owner prioritizes safety, those wielding the power of AI must be held to the highest ethical standards.</p><p>Furthermore, the potential for data overreach is alarming. The promise of proactive threat hunting must not become a pretext for mass surveillance. As conservatives, we believe in the right to privacy and the sanctity of individual data. The Fourth Amendment, guaranteeing protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, remains as relevant in the digital age as it was in 1791.</p><p><strong>Finding the Balance: Limited Government and Individual Responsibility</strong></p><p>The solution lies not in knee-jerk government regulation that stifles innovation, but in a balanced approach that emphasizes individual responsibility and limited, targeted oversight. We need to ensure that AI-driven cybersecurity solutions are developed and deployed in a manner that respects individual privacy and due process.</p><p>This means:</p><ul><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Algorithms should be explainable, and users should have the right to understand how their data is being used.</li><li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Developers and deployers of AI systems must be held accountable for any biases or inaccuracies that result in harm to individuals.</li><li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> Data collection should be limited to what is strictly necessary for effective threat hunting.</li><li><strong>Individual Control:</strong> Users should have the right to access, correct, and delete their data.</li></ul><p>The role of government should be limited to establishing clear guidelines and enforcing existing laws, such as those protecting privacy and preventing discrimination. We must avoid the temptation to create a bureaucratic behemoth that stifles innovation and further erodes individual liberty. As Ronald Reagan wisely stated, &ldquo;Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Prudence and Vigilance in the Digital Age</strong></p><p>AI-driven cybersecurity offers the potential to significantly enhance our defenses against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. However, we must proceed with caution, guided by our conservative principles of individual liberty, free markets, and limited government. By embracing innovation responsibly, demanding transparency and accountability, and safeguarding individual privacy, we can harness the power of AI to protect ourselves without sacrificing the freedoms that define our society. We must be vigilant, for the price of liberty is eternal vigilance, especially in the digital age.</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Progressive Voice</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>May 2, 2025 4:13 PM</span>

As cyberattacks grow in sophistication, the tech industry is pushing AI-driven proactive cybersecurity as the ultimate solution. But before we blindly embrace this shiny new tool, we on the progressive front must ask: at what cost? Is this truly enhanced security, or simply algorithmic overreach in disguise?</p><p><strong>The Promise: A Proactive Shield</strong></p><p>The allure of AI-driven threat hunting is undeniable. Imagine a system that continuously monitors networks, analyzes mountains of data, and identifies potential threats before they can even materialize. This promises a move away from reactive firefighting to a proactive defense, saving organizations time, resources, and potentially preventing catastrophic data breaches (Goodkind, D. et al., 2005). Advocates argue that this technology is essential to staying ahead of increasingly sophisticated cybercriminals and nation-state actors. They paint a picture of AI as a vigilant guardian, tirelessly working to protect our digital lives.</p><p><strong>The Peril: Algorithmic Bias and the Surveillance State</strong></p><p>However, the reality is far more complex and fraught with potential for abuse. Algorithmic bias, a well-documented phenomenon, poses a significant threat. AI systems are trained on data, and if that data reflects existing societal biases, the AI will inevitably perpetuate and even amplify them (O&rsquo;Neil, C., 2016). In the context of cybersecurity, this could mean that certain user groups or communities are disproportionately flagged as potential threats based on prejudiced assumptions.</p><p>Furthermore, the &ldquo;proactive&rdquo; nature of AI-driven threat hunting raises serious privacy concerns. The system requires vast amounts of data, potentially including personal information, to function effectively. This constant surveillance, even if supposedly anonymized, can chill free speech and create a climate of fear and self-censorship. The question isn&rsquo;t simply whether the data is being used &ldquo;for good,&rdquo; but whether the constant collection and analysis of personal information is justifiable in a free and democratic society.</p><p><strong>The Core Issue: Systemic Change, Not Technological Quick Fixes</strong></p><p>The push for AI-driven cybersecurity is often framed as a purely technological problem requiring a technological solution. This is a dangerous oversimplification. The root causes of cybersecurity vulnerabilities lie in systemic issues: inadequate funding for public sector cybersecurity, a lack of security awareness training, and the exploitation of vulnerabilities created by poorly designed and insufficiently tested software.</p><p>Relying solely on AI to solve these problems is like putting a band-aid on a gaping wound. We need systemic change: stronger regulations on data collection and use, robust oversight of AI algorithms, and a commitment to ethical AI development. We also need to prioritize cybersecurity education and invest in public infrastructure to ensure equitable access to secure digital services.</p><p><strong>Toward Responsible Implementation</strong></p><p>We are not advocating for the outright rejection of AI in cybersecurity. Technology, when used responsibly, can be a powerful tool for progress. However, we must demand stringent safeguards to prevent algorithmic bias and protect individual privacy. This includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> The algorithms used in AI-driven threat hunting must be transparent and auditable to ensure fairness and accountability.</li><li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Clear lines of responsibility must be established to address any harms caused by algorithmic bias or overreach.</li><li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> Data collection should be limited to only what is strictly necessary for the purpose of threat detection.</li><li><strong>Strong Oversight:</strong> Independent bodies must be established to oversee the development and deployment of AI-driven cybersecurity systems and ensure compliance with ethical standards.</li><li><strong>Community Involvement:</strong> Engaging communities impacted by this technology is critical in identifying biases and ensuring fair and equitable outcomes.</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion: Security Must Not Come at the Expense of Liberty</strong></p><p>The promise of AI-driven cybersecurity is alluring, but we must not let the pursuit of security blind us to the potential for algorithmic overreach and the erosion of privacy. True progress requires systemic change and a commitment to safeguarding civil liberties. We must demand transparency, accountability, and robust oversight mechanisms to ensure that AI serves as a shield for progress, not a Trojan horse for a surveillance state. The future of cybersecurity depends on it.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>Goodkind, D., Genser, B., & Vitek, M. (2005). <em>Cybercrime: A review of the evidence</em>.
