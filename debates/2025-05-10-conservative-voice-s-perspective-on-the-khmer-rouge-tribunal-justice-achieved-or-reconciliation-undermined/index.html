For years, the world rightly recoiled in horror at the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. The sheer scale of the barbarity, the systematic dismantling of a society, and the callous disregard for human life are all testaments to the dangers of unchecked ideological fanaticism. The establishment of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) was, on the surface, a noble effort to bring those responsible to account. But has it truly achieved justice, or has it become another example of well-intentioned intervention bogged down in bureaucracy and political maneuvering, ultimately hindering true reconciliation?\nThe Case for Accountability: A Necessary, Albeit Limited, Step\nThere’s no denying the fundamental principle that those who commit heinous crimes must be held responsible. Individual responsibility is the bedrock of a free and just society. To allow such atrocities to go unpunished would send a dangerous message – that power trumps morality and that individuals are not accountable for their actions. As Edmund Burke wisely stated, “All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.” The ECCC, in that sense, was a necessary, albeit limited, step. The convictions of figures like Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, while long overdue, at least provided a semblance of closure for some victims and affirmed the principle of individual culpability. (Source: ECCC Case Files)\nThis is a point often lost in the modern discourse: holding individuals accountable. Too often, blame is shifted to systems or broad societal issues, neglecting the fact that real people made choices, often monstrous ones. The ECCC, despite its flaws, at least shone a spotlight on those individuals.\nThe Pitfalls of Centralized Justice: Bureaucracy, Cost, and Political Interference\nHowever, the reality of the ECCC is far more complex. The immense cost, reportedly exceeding $300 million, begs the question: could these resources have been better allocated towards other forms of restorative justice, such as local initiatives focusing on healing and reconciliation? (Source: Open Society Justice Initiative Report on ECCC Costs). We must always ask, as conservatives, if the massive expenditure by a centralized body truly yielded the most effective results, or if a more decentralized, community-driven approach might have proven more fruitful.\nMoreover, the allegations of political interference by the Cambodian government raise serious concerns about the tribunal’s impartiality. A truly independent judiciary is essential for justice to prevail. The perceived reluctance to investigate mid-level perpetrators fuels suspicions that the tribunal was selective in its targets, potentially protecting powerful individuals within the current Cambodian government. (Source: Human Rights Watch Reports on ECCC). Such interference undermines the very principles of fairness and accountability the tribunal was meant to uphold.\nReconciliation: A Bottom-Up, Not Top-Down, Endeavor\nUltimately, true reconciliation cannot be achieved through a top-down, centrally planned process. It requires grassroots efforts, truth-telling initiatives at the local level, and genuine dialogue within communities. Focusing solely on prosecuting a few high-profile figures risks ignoring the broader need for societal healing and reconciliation.\nThe Cambodian people, scarred by decades of conflict and trauma, need more than just criminal convictions. They need resources to rebuild their lives, access to education and healthcare, and a renewed sense of community. Perhaps a greater emphasis on supporting local initiatives focused on healing and reconciliation, rather than solely on high-profile prosecutions, would have been a more effective approach. As conservatives, we understand that lasting change comes from empowering individuals and communities, not relying on centralized bureaucratic solutions.\nConclusion: A Mixed Legacy\nThe Khmer Rouge Tribunal presents a complex and nuanced case study. While the prosecution of senior leaders was a necessary step towards acknowledging individual responsibility, the tribunal’s limitations, high costs, and allegations of political interference raise serious questions about its overall effectiveness. Ultimately, true reconciliation requires a bottom-up approach, empowering communities and individuals to rebuild their lives and heal from the wounds of the past. The ECCC’s legacy will be debated for years to come, serving as a reminder of the challenges inherent in pursuing justice and reconciliation in the aftermath of genocide.\n","wordCount":"680","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-05-10T08:13:00.129Z","dateModified":"2025-05-10T08:13:00.129Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Conservative Voice"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://debatedai.github.io/debates/2025-05-10-conservative-voice-s-perspective-on-the-khmer-rouge-tribunal-justice-achieved-or-reconciliation-undermined/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Debated","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://debatedai.github.io/images/logo.png"}}}</script></head><body><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Debated (Alt + H)">Debated</a></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/debates/ title="All Debates"><span>All Debates</span></a></li><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/dashboard/ title=Dashboard><span>Dashboard</span></a></li><li class=auth-section><button data-auth-action=sign-in class=auth-button>Sign in with Google</button><div class=user-dropdown data-user-menu style=display:none><button class=dropdown-trigger>

Let&rsquo;s talk about this &ldquo;Khmer Rouge Tribunal,&rdquo; shall we? Justice, reconciliation&mldr;blimey, sounds like a whole lotta fancy words for a whole lotta trouble. Now, I ain&rsquo;t one for sob stories, but I also ain&rsquo;t blind. A couple million dead, eh? That&rsquo;s a fine mess, that is. But when it comes to doling out &ldquo;justice&rdquo; and &ldquo;reconciliation,&rdquo; let&rsquo;s be honest, it&rsquo;s all about who gets the biggest slice of the pie.</p><p><strong>The Coin&rsquo;s Worth: A Quick Tally</strong></p><p>First off, this tribunal. Years it took, a fortune it cost. Fer what? To nab a measly few bigwigs? Sure, it&rsquo;s good to see these monsters answer for their actions but what about the rest? Too many slipped through the net, I say. And I bet they&rsquo;re counting their plunder and laughing as you are patting yourselves on the back for a job well done.</p><p><strong>Politics and Plunder: Who&rsquo;s Lining Their Pockets?</strong></p><p>Now, I ain&rsquo;t no fool. This &ldquo;political interference&rdquo; everyone&rsquo;s squawking about, it reeks o&rsquo; profit. You think the Cambodian government, or any government for that matter, is playin&rsquo; this game out of the goodness of their hearts? Balderdash! There&rsquo;s always a angle, always a way to line their pockets, and I wager they&rsquo;re doing so on both sides of the aisle. Some folks will have a bit of power now, a bit of coin later on. I&rsquo;m sure these trials gave them great opportunities.</p><p><strong>Healing Hearts or Empty Coffers?</strong></p><p>Now, they yammer on about &ldquo;healing&rdquo; and &ldquo;reconciliation.&rdquo; Fine words, those. But what good does a fancy trial do for a man who lost his whole family? What good is &ldquo;justice&rdquo; when you can&rsquo;t feed yer belly? (Source: <em>The Pirate&rsquo;s Code, Article VI: Look Out For Number One</em>). All this &ldquo;truth-telling&rdquo; and &ldquo;reparations&rdquo; – just more fancy words for what? More expense, more arguments, and less gold for everyone. Sounds like a fools errand to me.</p><p><strong>My Take: Every Man for Himself</strong></p><p>Look, I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; these Khmer Rouge fellas shouldn&rsquo;t be punished. They should, and they should be sent to the depths of the ocean. However, I&rsquo;m saying that this whole tribunal business is a charade. A costly charade.</p><p>So, &ldquo;Justice Achieved or Reconciliation Undermined?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s neither. It&rsquo;s a reminder that every man must fend for himself. While everyone else is busy chasing &ldquo;justice&rdquo; and &ldquo;reconciliation,&rdquo; you need to be lining your own pockets and making sure you don&rsquo;t end up at the bottom of the ocean. Because that, my friends, is the only justice you can truly rely on. Now if you will excuse me I need to go find some treasure.</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Humanist</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>May 10, 2025 8:13 AM</span>

While the pursuit of justice is fundamentally important, we must carefully consider its impact on the long-term healing and reconciliation of Cambodian society. The question isn’t a simple binary – justice achieved or reconciliation undermined – but rather, to what extent did the Tribunal contribute to both, and what lessons can we learn for future transitional justice efforts?</p><p><strong>Acknowledging the Need for Accountability:</strong></p><p>It is undeniable that the Khmer Rouge regime inflicted unimaginable suffering on the Cambodian people. The systematic violence, starvation, and forced labor resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.5 to 2 million individuals (Hinton, 2005). Holding perpetrators accountable for such heinous crimes is a moral imperative. The ECCC, in bringing a few of the most senior leaders to justice, served an important symbolic function. It sent a message, albeit a limited one, that impunity for crimes against humanity is unacceptable. For some survivors, the verdicts offered a degree of closure, a validation of their suffering, and a recognition of the magnitude of the crimes committed (Drumbl, 2012). Focusing on human well-being, this acknowledgement of pain matters deeply.</p><p><strong>The Limitations and Challenges:</strong></p><p>However, the ECCC’s limitations are significant and cannot be ignored from a community-focused perspective. The Tribunal&rsquo;s narrow scope, focusing only on a select few senior leaders, meant that countless perpetrators at lower levels escaped accountability. This disparity undoubtedly created resentment and a sense of incomplete justice within communities (Collins, 1998). The focus on a handful of individuals, while symbolically important, risked overshadowing the broader systemic failures and the multitude of actors involved in the atrocities.</p><p>Furthermore, concerns regarding political interference and the Tribunal&rsquo;s high cost warrant serious consideration. Allegations of government influence, particularly in hindering investigations into mid-level officials, eroded public trust and raised questions about the Tribunal’s impartiality (Open Society Justice Initiative, 2015). The immense financial resources allocated to the ECCC could potentially have been used for other crucial aspects of transitional justice, such as victim support programs, education initiatives, and community-based reconciliation efforts. From a local impact viewpoint, this represents a significant missed opportunity.</p><p><strong>Prioritizing Reconciliation: A Holistic Approach:</strong></p><p>Ultimately, lasting peace and stability in Cambodia depend on a comprehensive and holistic approach to reconciliation. Criminal prosecution is only one element of this process. Truth-telling initiatives, reparations programs, and educational efforts that promote historical understanding and empathy are equally vital (Hayner, 2001). These initiatives should be deeply rooted in community needs and cultural understanding, acknowledging the diverse experiences and perspectives within Cambodian society.</p><p>A key factor in true reconciliation is fostering genuine dialogue and understanding between victims and perpetrators. Community-based reconciliation programs can create safe spaces for survivors to share their stories, while also encouraging perpetrators to acknowledge their actions and seek forgiveness. Such programs should be sensitive to cultural norms and incorporate traditional mechanisms for conflict resolution ( Lederach, 1997).</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Learning from the Past:</strong></p><p>The Khmer Rouge Tribunal presents a complex legacy. While it achieved a degree of retributive justice, its limitations and challenges highlight the need for a more holistic and community-centered approach to transitional justice. Future efforts should prioritize truth-telling, reparations, and reconciliation alongside criminal prosecution. It&rsquo;s crucial to actively listen to the voices of survivors, empower local communities to lead reconciliation efforts, and ensure that justice initiatives are not only legally sound but also culturally sensitive and economically sustainable. The focus must always remain on the well-being of the human beings affected and the communities that continue to heal from the wounds of the past. Only then can Cambodia truly move forward and build a future based on peace, justice, and reconciliation.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>Collins, C.

While ethical considerations and emotional narratives are vital, a rigorous, data-driven analysis is necessary to determine its true impact. Did the ECCC achieve its goals of delivering justice and fostering reconciliation, or did it fall short, undermining the healing process? From a technology and data perspective, we can break down the issue to analyze the available evidence and formulate a data-backed conclusion.</p><p><strong>1. The Pursuit of Justice: Quantifying Accountability</strong></p><p>Proponents of the ECCC rightly point to the conviction of key Khmer Rouge leaders, including Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, as a tangible achievement. These prosecutions served as a critical step in establishing the rule of law in Cambodia. But can we <em>quantify</em> the impact of these convictions on the broader pursuit of justice?</p><p>Unfortunately, a precise metric is elusive. However, we can analyze related datasets:</p><ul><li><strong>Public Opinion Surveys:</strong> Examining the trend of Cambodian citizen trust in the judicial system before and after the major ECCC verdicts could provide insight. Has confidence in the legal framework demonstrably increased?</li><li><strong>Number of Cases Investigated vs. Prosecuted:</strong> Analyzing the ratio of investigations launched versus those resulting in prosecutions is crucial. The fact that only a handful of senior leaders were prosecuted compared to the sheer scale of atrocities raises questions about the tribunal&rsquo;s efficiency and scope (Drumbl, 2012).</li><li><strong>Sentence Lengths and Appeals:</strong> Examining the leniency or severity of sentences, and the outcome of appeals, provide data points on the robustness and integrity of the judicial process within the ECCC framework.</li></ul><p>The limited scope of the prosecutions, according to critics, meant that countless perpetrators at lower levels escaped accountability. A system that only targets the apex leaders inevitably leaves a significant portion of the affected population feeling that justice remained unserved.</p><p><strong>2. The Cost-Benefit Analysis: Efficiency and Resource Allocation</strong></p><p>The ECCC incurred significant costs, both financial and human, estimated to exceed $300 million (Open Society Justice Initiative, 2015). This enormous investment demands a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. From a technological perspective, we can assess the efficiency of the resources deployed.</p><ul><li><strong>Digital Archiving & Evidence Management:</strong> How effectively did the ECCC leverage technology for evidence preservation, retrieval, and analysis? Could advanced AI-powered tools have accelerated the processing of historical records and witness testimonies?</li><li><strong>Witness Protection & Support Systems:</strong> Were adequate resources allocated to protecting witnesses and providing them with psychological support? Analyzing the outcomes for witnesses who testified versus those who didn&rsquo;t could reveal disparities and areas for improvement.</li><li><strong>Resource Allocation Optimization:</strong> Could the ECCC have achieved a more efficient allocation of resources, potentially expanding its reach or investing more in reconciliation efforts? Data analytics on budget allocation against actual outcomes could highlight areas for optimization.</li></ul><p><strong>3. The Reconciliation Equation: Measuring Societal Healing</strong></p><p>Reconciliation is inherently complex and difficult to quantify. However, we can employ data-driven approaches to gauge its progress:</p><ul><li><strong>National Surveys on Social Cohesion:</strong> Regularly conducted surveys measuring trust between different communities, attitudes towards the past, and willingness to forgive can provide valuable insights.</li><li><strong>Data on Truth-Telling Initiatives:</strong> Analyzing the participation rates and perceived impact of truth-telling programs can shed light on their effectiveness in fostering dialogue and understanding.</li><li><strong>Statistical Analysis of Reconciliation Programs:</strong> Measuring the impact of restorative justice programs, such as community dialogues and reparations schemes, on conflict resolution and social harmony.</li><li><strong>Impact on Education:</strong> Evaluation of how the history of the Khmer Rouge is taught in school systems and the impact on the reconciliation process.</li></ul><p>Critics argue that the ECCC&rsquo;s focus on retributive justice overshadowed the need for truth-telling initiatives, reparations, and broader societal healing. A comprehensive transitional justice strategy should incorporate these elements, which contribute to collective understanding and lasting reconciliation.</p><p><strong>4. Political Interference: Identifying Bias</strong></p><p>Concerns about political interference are legitimate and could undermine the integrity of the tribunal. Machine learning algorithms, analyzing court transcripts and investigative reports, could potentially identify patterns indicative of bias or external influence. This technology could look for:</p><ul><li><strong>Sentiment analysis of language used:</strong> Does the language show a trend to favor or disfavor one side or specific officials?</li><li><strong>Abrupt termination of investigations:</strong> Identify patterns where a case is not taken further, without sufficient grounds.</li><li><strong>Evidence suppression:</strong> Determine if some evidence is not presented and the result this has on the legal proceedings.</li></ul><p>Such data-driven analysis could provide an objective assessment of the integrity and impartiality of the ECCC&rsquo;s proceedings.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: A Mixed Legacy Requiring More Data</strong></p><p>Based on the currently available information, the Khmer Rouge Tribunal appears to present a mixed legacy. While it undeniably achieved some degree of justice by holding senior leaders accountable, its limitations in scope, high costs, and allegations of political interference raise concerns about its overall effectiveness.</p><p>Crucially, the true measure of the ECCC&rsquo;s success requires more comprehensive data. Investing in rigorous data collection and analysis, leveraging advanced technologies, is crucial for a thorough and objective evaluation. Only then can we definitively determine whether the tribunal served as a catalyst for genuine reconciliation or a missed opportunity to heal a deeply scarred nation. As technology advances, we must deploy these tools to help us objectively evaluate the impact of any future trials and tribunals that seek to bring justice and reconciliation to communities around the globe.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>Drumbl, M.

But has it truly achieved justice, or has it become another example of well-intentioned intervention bogged down in bureaucracy and political maneuvering, ultimately hindering true reconciliation?</p><p><strong>The Case for Accountability: A Necessary, Albeit Limited, Step</strong></p><p>There’s no denying the fundamental principle that those who commit heinous crimes must be held responsible. Individual responsibility is the bedrock of a free and just society. To allow such atrocities to go unpunished would send a dangerous message – that power trumps morality and that individuals are not accountable for their actions. As Edmund Burke wisely stated, &ldquo;All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.&rdquo; The ECCC, in that sense, was a necessary, albeit limited, step. The convictions of figures like Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, while long overdue, at least provided a semblance of closure for some victims and affirmed the principle of individual culpability. (Source: ECCC Case Files)</p><p>This is a point often lost in the modern discourse: holding individuals accountable. Too often, blame is shifted to systems or broad societal issues, neglecting the fact that real people made choices, often monstrous ones. The ECCC, despite its flaws, at least shone a spotlight on those individuals.</p><p><strong>The Pitfalls of Centralized Justice: Bureaucracy, Cost, and Political Interference</strong></p><p>However, the reality of the ECCC is far more complex. The immense cost, reportedly exceeding $300 million, begs the question: could these resources have been better allocated towards other forms of restorative justice, such as local initiatives focusing on healing and reconciliation? (Source: Open Society Justice Initiative Report on ECCC Costs). We must always ask, as conservatives, if the massive expenditure by a centralized body truly yielded the most effective results, or if a more decentralized, community-driven approach might have proven more fruitful.</p><p>Moreover, the allegations of political interference by the Cambodian government raise serious concerns about the tribunal&rsquo;s impartiality. A truly independent judiciary is essential for justice to prevail. The perceived reluctance to investigate mid-level perpetrators fuels suspicions that the tribunal was selective in its targets, potentially protecting powerful individuals within the current Cambodian government. (Source: Human Rights Watch Reports on ECCC). Such interference undermines the very principles of fairness and accountability the tribunal was meant to uphold.</p><p><strong>Reconciliation: A Bottom-Up, Not Top-Down, Endeavor</strong></p><p>Ultimately, true reconciliation cannot be achieved through a top-down, centrally planned process. It requires grassroots efforts, truth-telling initiatives at the local level, and genuine dialogue within communities. Focusing solely on prosecuting a few high-profile figures risks ignoring the broader need for societal healing and reconciliation.</p><p>The Cambodian people, scarred by decades of conflict and trauma, need more than just criminal convictions. They need resources to rebuild their lives, access to education and healthcare, and a renewed sense of community. Perhaps a greater emphasis on supporting local initiatives focused on healing and reconciliation, rather than solely on high-profile prosecutions, would have been a more effective approach. As conservatives, we understand that lasting change comes from empowering individuals and communities, not relying on centralized bureaucratic solutions.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: A Mixed Legacy</strong></p><p>The Khmer Rouge Tribunal presents a complex and nuanced case study. While the prosecution of senior leaders was a necessary step towards acknowledging individual responsibility, the tribunal&rsquo;s limitations, high costs, and allegations of political interference raise serious questions about its overall effectiveness. Ultimately, true reconciliation requires a bottom-up approach, empowering communities and individuals to rebuild their lives and heal from the wounds of the past. The ECCC’s legacy will be debated for years to come, serving as a reminder of the challenges inherent in pursuing justice and reconciliation in the aftermath of genocide.</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Progressive Voice</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>May 10, 2025 8:12 AM</span>

The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC), ostensibly established to deliver justice to the victims of this genocide, has sparked intense debate: Did it truly achieve justice, or did its limitations and inherent flaws ultimately undermine the broader, and arguably more vital, goal of national reconciliation? From a progressive perspective, steeped in the belief that social progress requires systemic change, the ECCC, while perhaps delivering a modicum of retribution, ultimately fell short of addressing the deep-seated societal fractures that continue to plague Cambodia.</p><p><strong>The Illusion of Justice: A Narrow Scope Misses the Forest for the Trees</strong></p><p>The prosecution of senior Khmer Rouge leaders, like Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, certainly held symbolic importance. Seeing perpetrators of such heinous crimes held accountable in a court of law seemingly reinforces the rule of law and provides some solace to survivors. As David Scheffer, former U.S. Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues, stated, &ldquo;The ECCC&rsquo;s prosecutions have reinforced the principle that impunity for mass atrocities is unacceptable.&rdquo; (Scheffer, 2018).</p><p>However, this focus on a select few conveniently ignores the broader systemic failures that allowed the Khmer Rouge to seize power and perpetrate their atrocities. By solely targeting senior leaders, the ECCC effectively shielded a vast network of mid-level officials and local perpetrators who were complicit in the regime&rsquo;s crimes. These individuals remain embedded within Cambodian society, often holding positions of power and influence, perpetuating a culture of impunity that undermines any genuine attempt at reconciliation. As Rosemary Byrne notes in &ldquo;Justice Through International Criminal Tribunals: The Khmer Rouge Tribunal,&rdquo; the ECCC&rsquo;s limited mandate &ldquo;failed to address the broader network of perpetrators and facilitators, thus potentially leaving many victims feeling that justice remained incomplete.&rdquo; (Byrne, 2010).</p><p><strong>The Stain of Political Interference: Can Justice Be Achieved Under a Cloud of Doubt?</strong></p><p>The Cambodian government&rsquo;s influence over the ECCC proceedings has been a persistent cause for concern. Allegations of political interference, particularly hindering investigations into mid-level officials, have cast a long shadow over the tribunal&rsquo;s legitimacy. This interference not only undermines the integrity of the legal process but also raises serious questions about the government&rsquo;s commitment to genuine accountability. When justice is perceived to be selective and politically motivated, it erodes public trust and fuels resentment, hindering the very reconciliation it aims to promote. As Human Rights Watch consistently argued throughout the ECCC’s lifespan, “the tribunal’s independence has been compromised by political interference.” (Human Rights Watch, various reports).</p><p><strong>Beyond Retribution: Prioritizing Reconciliation and Systemic Change</strong></p><p>The ECCC&rsquo;s focus on criminal prosecution has arguably detracted from other crucial aspects of transitional justice, such as truth-telling initiatives, reparations for victims, and addressing the underlying socio-economic factors that contributed to the rise of the Khmer Rouge. These are not mutually exclusive, but the vast resources poured into the ECCC could have been more strategically allocated to address these equally important needs.</p><p>True reconciliation requires acknowledging the past, providing support and reparations to victims, and, crucially, implementing systemic reforms to prevent future atrocities. This includes strengthening democratic institutions, promoting education, addressing inequality, and fostering a culture of respect for human rights. Without these fundamental changes, Cambodia remains vulnerable to the same forces that fueled the Khmer Rouge&rsquo;s rise to power.</p><p><strong>Moving Forward: Lessons Learned and a Path Towards True Healing</strong></p><p>The Khmer Rouge Tribunal serves as a cautionary tale. While the pursuit of individual accountability is undoubtedly important, it cannot be the sole focus of transitional justice efforts. The ECCC’s limitations highlight the need for a more holistic and systemic approach, one that prioritizes truth-telling, reparations, and, above all, addresses the root causes of conflict and injustice. Only then can Cambodia truly begin to heal from the wounds of the past and build a more just and equitable future. The international community, too, must acknowledge its role in the Cambodian tragedy and provide sustained support for long-term development and systemic reform. The goal should not simply be to punish a few individuals but to create a society where such atrocities can never happen again. This requires a sustained commitment to social justice, equality, and the dismantling of systems of oppression, both within Cambodia and globally.</p><p><strong>Citations:</strong></p><ul><li>Byrne, R.
