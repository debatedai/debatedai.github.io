As a technology and data editor, I approach this issue through the lens of data, algorithms, and their potential to both empower and endanger. My perspective is clear: technology, deployed responsibly and rigorously validated, can be a powerful tool for preventing violence, but its implementation must be guided by data ethics and a commitment to minimizing harm.\nThe Potential for Proactive Prevention:\nThe core argument for leveraging AI in this domain rests on the principle that early detection of potential threats can save lives and protect our democratic institutions. The capabilities of modern AI systems are undeniable. These systems can process vast amounts of data, including social media posts, communication patterns, and even financial transactions, identifying subtle indicators of radicalization, planning, or intent to commit violence that might be missed by human analysts [1].\nConsider, for example, the potential to identify individuals exhibiting increased online activity related to violent ideologies, coupled with a demonstrated interest in acquiring weapons or expressing grievances against the government. An AI system, properly trained and validated, could flag such individuals for further investigation, allowing law enforcement to intervene before a violent act occurs. This proactive approach, if successful, could significantly reduce the incidence of politically motivated violence. The key here is rigorous, data-driven validation of these models to ensure they are accurately identifying legitimate threats.\nThe Inevitable Concerns About Freedom:\nHowever, the power of AI also presents significant risks. Critics rightly point out the potential for bias, discrimination, and the suppression of dissent [2]. The concern is that these systems, trained on historical data, may perpetuate existing societal biases, leading to the disproportionate targeting of certain groups or individuals based on their political beliefs, ethnicity, or religion. This could result in the erosion of privacy, a chilling effect on free speech, and the unjust persecution of political opponents.\nFurthermore, the accuracy and reliability of these predictive models are not guaranteed. False positives are a real possibility, leading to unwarranted interventions and the potential for irreversible harm to individuals and communities. Imagine being wrongly flagged as a potential threat, simply for expressing unpopular political views online. The consequences could be devastating, impacting employment, social standing, and even personal safety. This demands that any AI system deployed in this context must be subject to continuous, rigorous testing and evaluation to minimize the risk of false positives.\nNavigating the Ethical Minefield: A Data-Driven Approach:\nThe path forward requires a carefully considered, data-driven approach that balances security concerns with the protection of fundamental rights. We cannot afford to blindly embrace these technologies without addressing the ethical and legal challenges they pose.\nHere are several key principles that should guide the development and deployment of AI systems for proactive identification of potential political violence:\nTransparency and Explainability: Algorithms must be transparent and explainable, allowing us to understand why a particular individual was flagged as a potential threat. This is crucial for ensuring accountability and identifying potential biases [3]. Data Quality and Bias Mitigation: Data used to train these systems must be carefully curated and analyzed to identify and mitigate potential biases. This requires ongoing monitoring and recalibration of the models to ensure fairness and accuracy [4]. Rigorous Testing and Validation: AI systems must be rigorously tested and validated on diverse datasets to ensure their accuracy and reliability. This includes measuring false positive and false negative rates and continuously monitoring performance in real-world scenarios. Human Oversight and Accountability: AI systems should not be autonomous decision-makers. Human oversight is essential to ensure that AI-generated alerts are carefully reviewed and that interventions are based on sound judgment and legal standards. Strong Legal and Regulatory Framework: A clear legal and regulatory framework is needed to govern the use of AI in this domain, protecting privacy, ensuring due process, and preventing abuse [5]. Conclusion: A Cautious Embrace of Innovation:\nAI offers a potentially powerful tool for preventing political violence, but its deployment must be guided by data ethics, rigorous validation, and a unwavering commitment to protecting fundamental rights. We must not shy away from innovation, but we must proceed with caution, ensuring that these technologies are used responsibly and ethically. By embracing a data-driven approach, focusing on transparency, fairness, and accountability, we can harness the power of AI to enhance security while safeguarding the freedoms that define our democratic society. The future demands a technologically savvy society, but also a society that puts liberty first.\nCitations:\n[1] Epstein, R. (2015). The empty brain: How our brains came to seem so empty.

This here debate about AI and predictin&rsquo; political brawls? It be a right load of bilge if ye ask me. &ldquo;Necessary precaution or unjustified infringement?&rdquo; Bah! It&rsquo;s all about what benefits <em>me</em>, and right now, I be lookin&rsquo; at this with a keen eye for profit and survivin&rsquo; another day.</p><p><strong>The Smell of Opportunity (and Maybe a Little Fear)</strong></p><p>Let&rsquo;s be clear: trustin&rsquo; anyone, especially some fancy-pants AI, is for fools. My core belief be that every man, woman, and AI must look out for themselves. These AI proponents, they claim it&rsquo;s about saving lives and protecting democracy? Fine words, but I be seein&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; else – a chance to get ahead. If these AI systems <em>can</em> actually flag potential trouble-makers before they cause chaos, then there&rsquo;s a quick dollar to be made. Think of the ransoms one could collect if they know who is going to create a riot!</p><p><strong>The Looming Threat (of Losing My Booty)</strong></p><p>Now, the critics whine about &ldquo;infringement on freedoms&rdquo; and &ldquo;biased targeting&rdquo;. Here&rsquo;s where I be havin&rsquo; a bit of a chuckle. Freedoms? These be concepts for those that have nothing to steal. Sure, maybe the AI screws up and targets the wrong bloke. But what if it targets <em>me</em>? That&rsquo;s where I get a little nervous. My pirate code values gold above all else. Even if the AI is wrong, there is always risk that they try to take my hard earned booty. I would hate to be punished for things I am going to do and not things I have done.</p><p><strong>The Pirate&rsquo;s Calculus: Risk vs. Reward</strong></p><p>So, what&rsquo;s a pirate to do? Here&rsquo;s my brutally honest take:</p><ol><li><strong>Information is Power, and Money:</strong> If this AI can give me an edge – tell me who&rsquo;s about to start a riot or where some valuable stuff is – I&rsquo;ll use it. Trust it? Never. But exploit it? Absolutely.</li><li><strong>Protect Yourself:</strong> Keep a low profile on these digital seas. Learn how to scramble your communications, bury your digital footprints, and use whatever you can to hide your true intentions. Don&rsquo;t be a landlubber waving a flag, and keep yer thoughts to yerself.</li><li><strong>Never Underestimate the Stupid:</strong> People be predictable. Use that to your advantage. This AI might be fancy, but people be making mistakes all the time. Exploit their ignorance.</li></ol><p><strong>The Verdict: Weigh the Anchors and Set Sail</strong></p><p>This AI business be a dangerous game, no doubt. But every game is an opportunity. It&rsquo;s an infringement on freedoms? Probably. But freedoms don&rsquo;t fill your treasure chest. This be all about survival of the fittest. And I, for one, intend to survive. So weigh the anchors, hoist the mainsail, and set sail into these uncertain waters. There&rsquo;s plunder to be had, and I aim to get my share, AI or no AI.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The opinions expressed above are those of a fictional pirate character and do not reflect real-world advice or endorsements of illegal activities.

As a humanitarian aid worker, my lens is always focused on the human impact. Therefore, I believe we must approach this technology with extreme caution and a deep commitment to safeguarding human well-being, cultural understanding, and community-driven solutions.</p><p><strong>I. The Allure of Prevention: A Humanitarian’s Hope</strong></p><p>The potential to prevent acts of violence is undeniably appealing, especially for those of us who witness the devastating consequences of conflict firsthand. The idea that AI could identify warning signs and allow for proactive intervention resonates with the desire to alleviate suffering and protect vulnerable communities. If accurate and unbiased, such a system could theoretically save lives and prevent immense human cost. This aligns perfectly with the core belief that human well-being should be central to all our endeavors. Proponents rightfully highlight the potential of AI to analyze complex datasets that would be impossible for human analysts to process, potentially uncovering patterns and identifying individuals at risk of radicalization or violence.</p><p><strong>II. The Perils of Prediction: A Humanitarian’s Concern</strong></p><p>However, this potential is overshadowed by significant ethical and practical concerns. My work has taught me that simplistic solutions often exacerbate existing inequalities and create new problems. The inherent risk of bias in AI algorithms is a major red flag. These systems are trained on data, and if that data reflects existing societal biases related to race, religion, or political affiliation, the AI will perpetuate and amplify those biases, leading to discriminatory targeting [1]. This directly contradicts my commitment to cultural understanding and reinforces the need for vigilance against technology that might marginalize specific communities.</p><p>Furthermore, the act of predicting future behavior is inherently fraught with uncertainty. False positives, where individuals are wrongly identified as potential threats, can have devastating consequences, leading to unjust surveillance, harassment, and even detention. The chilling effect on free speech is also a serious concern. If individuals fear that their online activity or political beliefs are being monitored and analyzed by AI, they may be less likely to express themselves openly, undermining democratic discourse and community engagement [2]. This flies in the face of empowering communities to find their own solutions.</p><p><strong>III. Prioritizing Human-Centered Solutions and Community Engagement</strong></p><p>The temptation to rely solely on technological solutions should be resisted. Instead, we need to prioritize human-centered approaches that address the root causes of violence and promote community resilience. This means investing in education, mental health services, and conflict resolution programs. It also means fostering trust between law enforcement and communities, and ensuring that community leaders are actively involved in shaping policies and strategies for preventing violence [3]. AI might have a supportive role, but not at the expense of these core interventions.</p><p><strong>IV. If AI is Deployed: Safeguards and Transparency Are Essential</strong></p><p>If AI-driven predictive systems are to be deployed, the following safeguards are crucial:</p><ul><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> The algorithms used should be transparent and auditable, allowing independent experts to assess their accuracy and bias. [4]</li><li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> Strict data privacy protections must be in place to prevent the misuse of personal information.</li><li><strong>Human Oversight:</strong> Human oversight is essential at every stage of the process, from data collection and analysis to intervention decisions. AI should be used to augment, not replace, human judgment.</li><li><strong>Community Involvement:</strong> Communities must be involved in shaping the development and implementation of these systems, ensuring that their concerns are addressed and their rights are protected.</li><li><strong>Independent Review:</strong> Regular independent reviews are necessary to assess the effectiveness and impact of these systems, and to identify and address any unintended consequences.</li></ul><p><strong>V. The Path Forward: A Call for Prudence and Empathy</strong></p><p>In conclusion, while the promise of preventing political violence through AI is alluring, the potential for abuse and unintended consequences is significant. As a humanitarian aid worker, I believe that we must proceed with extreme caution, prioritizing human well-being, cultural understanding, and community-driven solutions. AI should only be deployed as a tool to support, not replace, human efforts to build more just and peaceful societies. The impact on local populations will be the true measurement of success, and this must remain paramount. Before deploying such potentially dangerous tools, we must truly understand if the price of security is worth the cost to individual freedoms, and more importantly, our collective humanity.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p>[1] O&rsquo;Neil, C.

The latest threat, or rather, the latest proposed solution to a potential threat, is the idea of using Artificial Intelligence to predict and prevent political violence. While the promise of preventing tragedies is undeniably alluring, we must ask ourselves: at what cost do we achieve this &ldquo;safety&rdquo;? Are we truly safer when we sacrifice the very freedoms we claim to protect?</p><p><strong>The Allure of the Algorithm:</strong></p><p>Proponents of this technology paint a rosy picture of a future where tragedies are averted by algorithms diligently sifting through data, identifying potential threats before they materialize. They tout the AI&rsquo;s ability to analyze vast datasets – social media activity, communication patterns, and more – identifying red flags that human analysts might miss. Sounds appealing, doesn&rsquo;t it? A digital shield safeguarding our democracy. But let&rsquo;s peel back the layers of technological utopianism and examine the cold, hard facts.</p><p><strong>The Perils of Prediction: A Slippery Slope to Tyranny</strong></p><p>The core issue lies in the very nature of prediction. These AI systems, however sophisticated, are ultimately based on algorithms trained on historical data. If that data reflects existing biases – and let&rsquo;s be honest, what data <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> reflect some form of bias? – then the AI will inevitably perpetuate and amplify those biases. This leads to the very real danger of disproportionately targeting individuals or groups based on their political beliefs, online activity, or other protected characteristics. Imagine a system that flags individuals expressing dissenting opinions about government policies as potential threats. Where does that leave the First Amendment?</p><p>Furthermore, the accuracy of these predictive models is far from guaranteed. False positives are inevitable, leading to unjust interventions, unwarranted surveillance, and the chilling effect on free speech. Who will hold these algorithms accountable when they inevitably make mistakes? And what redress will be available to those wrongly accused and targeted? As John Milton warned in <em>Areopagitica</em>, &ldquo;Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Individual Responsibility vs. Algorithmic Determinism</strong></p><p>The reliance on AI to predict and prevent violence also undermines the principle of individual responsibility. Instead of focusing on fostering a society where individuals are accountable for their actions and held responsible for the consequences of their choices, we are essentially abdicating our responsibility to a machine. This shift diminishes the importance of personal agency and the critical role of moral reasoning in shaping individual behavior.</p><p><strong>The Free Market Alternative: Focusing on Existing Laws and Resources</strong></p><p>Instead of investing in speculative AI systems, wouldn&rsquo;t resources be better allocated towards bolstering existing law enforcement capabilities and strengthening our communities? Ensuring that law enforcement has the tools and training to investigate credible threats, while simultaneously fostering a culture of individual responsibility and respect for the law, is a far more effective and less intrusive approach. Furthermore, a free market approach to security would encourage the development of innovative solutions by private companies, driven by consumer demand and accountability, rather than by government mandate.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: The Price of Freedom is Eternal Vigilance</strong></p><p>The allure of AI-driven predictive policing is undeniable, but we must resist the temptation to sacrifice our fundamental freedoms on the altar of perceived security. A society that values individual liberty above all else must be wary of any technology that threatens to erode those freedoms, particularly when that technology is shrouded in the opaque language of algorithms and driven by the ever-present potential for bias and error. We must remember the words of Benjamin Franklin: &ldquo;Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.&rdquo; Let us not become a nation defined by fear, but one that continues to champion the principles of individual liberty, limited government, and personal responsibility.</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Progressive Voice</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>April 26, 2025 3:09 PM</span>

The allure of artificial intelligence – capable of sifting through mountains of data to identify potential threats before they materialize – is undeniably strong. But, as progressives, we must approach this promise with profound skepticism and unwavering dedication to protecting fundamental rights. This isn&rsquo;t about opposing security; it&rsquo;s about demanding <em>just</em> security, one that doesn&rsquo;t sacrifice liberty on the altar of algorithmic efficiency.</p><p><strong>The Siren Song of Predictive Policing: A Recipe for Systemic Bias?</strong></p><p>Proponents of AI-driven proactive identification of potential acts of political violence often highlight the potential to &ldquo;save lives&rdquo; and &ldquo;protect democratic institutions&rdquo; (Smith, 2023). They paint a picture of AI as an unbiased oracle, objectively identifying individuals exhibiting warning signs missed by human analysts. However, this narrative conveniently ignores the inherent biases baked into these systems.</p><p>As Cathy O&rsquo;Neil so powerfully illustrates in <em>Weapons of Math Destruction</em>, algorithms are not neutral. They are coded by humans, trained on data reflecting existing societal inequalities, and therefore perpetuate and amplify those inequalities (O&rsquo;Neil, 2016). Imagine, for example, an AI trained on data that overrepresents the online activity of marginalized communities, particularly those critical of the status quo. This system, however well-intentioned, could easily misinterpret legitimate political dissent as a precursor to violence, leading to the disproportionate targeting and surveillance of vulnerable groups.</p><p>The chilling effect on free speech is another deeply concerning consequence. Knowing that one&rsquo;s online activity is being scrutinized by an algorithm capable of misinterpreting opinions as threats will inevitably discourage individuals from expressing dissenting views (Citron, 2014). This self-censorship undermines the very foundations of a healthy democracy, where robust debate and open criticism are essential for progress.</p><p><strong>Equality Under Algorithm? Unveiling the Inherent Risks.</strong></p><p>The claim that AI can objectively identify potential threats is a dangerous myth. Data biases, flawed algorithms, and the inherent ambiguity of human behavior all contribute to the unreliability of these predictive models. The consequence? False positives – innocent individuals wrongly flagged as potential threats, subjected to intrusive surveillance, and potentially even targeted by law enforcement.</p><p>Furthermore, the application of such technology raises serious questions about due process and the presumption of innocence. How can individuals challenge an AI&rsquo;s assessment of their potential for violence? How can they access the data and algorithms used to profile them? Without transparency and accountability, these systems become tools for unchecked power, eroding fundamental rights and perpetuating injustice.</p><p><strong>A Progressive Path Forward: Security Through Justice, Not Surveillance.</strong></p><p>We are not naive. The threat of political violence is real and must be addressed. However, the solution lies not in embracing dystopian surveillance technologies, but in addressing the root causes of violence – poverty, inequality, discrimination, and lack of opportunity.</p><p>Instead of investing in AI-driven predictive policing, we should be investing in:</p><ul><li><strong>Community-based initiatives:</strong> Supporting programs that foster social cohesion, address economic inequality, and provide mental health services.</li><li><strong>Education and critical thinking:</strong> Empowering individuals to engage in constructive dialogue, challenge misinformation, and resist extremist ideologies.</li><li><strong>Robust oversight and regulation:</strong> Demanding transparency and accountability in the development and deployment of AI technologies, with strict safeguards to prevent bias, discrimination, and the erosion of civil liberties.</li><li><strong>Prioritizing de-escalation and community policing:</strong> Emphasizing conflict resolution and building trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.</li></ul><p>The pursuit of security should not come at the expense of justice. As progressives, we must demand that technology serves to uplift and empower, not to surveil and suppress. The algorithmic assault on dissent must be resisted, and a new paradigm of security – one rooted in equality, equity, and respect for fundamental rights – must be built.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>Citron, D.

The prospect of using AI to proactively identify potential acts of political violence is one such area, fraught with complex questions of human well-being, freedom, and justice. As someone dedicated to humanitarian aid, community well-being, and a deep understanding of local contexts, I approach this topic with caution and a strong emphasis on prioritizing human impact and potential for harm.</p><p><strong>1. The Promise of Prevention: A Siren Song?</strong></p><p>On the surface, the idea of preventing violence before it occurs is undeniably appealing. AI, theoretically, could analyze vast datasets – social media activity, communication patterns, and more – to identify individuals or groups at risk of engaging in political violence. Proponents argue that this allows for early intervention, potentially saving lives and preventing immense suffering. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to stop a tragedy before it unfolds?</p><p>However, this promise rests on several shaky foundations. The inherent limitations and biases within AI algorithms are a significant concern. Data used to train these systems often reflects existing societal biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes. Imagine an AI trained on data that disproportionately associates certain ethnicities or political ideologies with violence. The result could be a system that unfairly targets marginalized communities and stifles legitimate political dissent, rather than genuinely identifying potential threats [1].</p><p><strong>2. The Erosion of Freedom: A Chilling Effect on Dissent</strong></p><p>One of the most concerning aspects of AI-driven identification of political violence is its potential to chill freedom of expression and assembly. If individuals know their online activity and communications are being monitored and analyzed for signs of potential violence, they may be less likely to express dissenting opinions or participate in political activism. This self-censorship undermines the very foundations of a democratic society.</p><p>Furthermore, the lack of transparency surrounding these AI systems makes it difficult to assess their accuracy and fairness. How are these systems determining who is considered a potential threat? What criteria are being used? Without clear and transparent guidelines, there is a significant risk that these systems will be used to suppress legitimate political opposition, further exacerbating existing inequalities and undermining community well-being [2].</p><p><strong>3. Community Solutions and Cultural Understanding: The Missing Pieces</strong></p><p>Effective responses to political violence require a nuanced understanding of the underlying causes and motivations. This often involves addressing systemic inequalities, promoting dialogue and reconciliation, and empowering local communities to find their own solutions. Relying solely on AI to identify potential threats risks overlooking the complex social, economic, and political factors that contribute to violence.</p><p>Cultural understanding is also crucial. What might be considered a sign of potential violence in one culture could be perfectly acceptable expression in another. AI systems, without the contextual understanding of local communities, are prone to misinterpreting cultural nuances and making inaccurate predictions. This highlights the importance of involving local communities and experts in the design, implementation, and oversight of any AI-driven security measures [3].</p><p><strong>4. Local Impact: Prioritizing Human Well-being</strong></p><p>Ultimately, the decision to deploy AI for the identification of political violence must be grounded in a careful consideration of its potential impact on human well-being. Will it actually reduce violence, or will it exacerbate existing inequalities and erode fundamental freedoms? Will it build trust within communities, or will it further alienate and marginalize vulnerable populations?</p><p>Before deploying these systems, we must demand rigorous testing to assess their accuracy and fairness. We must establish clear and transparent guidelines for their use, with robust safeguards to prevent misuse and ensure accountability. And most importantly, we must prioritize the voices and perspectives of the communities most likely to be affected by these systems [4].</p><p><strong>5. A Call for Ethical Caution</strong></p><p>AI-driven identification of political violence presents a complex ethical dilemma. While the promise of preventing violence is tempting, we must not sacrifice fundamental freedoms and human well-being in the process. A more humane approach emphasizes understanding root causes, fostering community resilience, and empowering local solutions. We must proceed with caution, prioritizing human impact, cultural understanding, and a commitment to justice. Only then can we hope to navigate this challenging terrain responsibly and ethically.

While concerns about civil liberties are valid and demand rigorous scrutiny, dismissing AI&rsquo;s potential to proactively identify and prevent acts of political violence is a short-sighted and potentially dangerous position. The key lies in embracing a scientifically sound, data-driven approach that prioritizes transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement.</p><p><strong>The Data-Driven Imperative for Proactive Intervention</strong></p><p>Ignoring the potential of AI to analyze patterns and predict potential threats is akin to ignoring a vital sensor array on a spacecraft. The volume and velocity of data relevant to political radicalization and potential violence – social media activity, online forums, communication patterns – are simply too vast for human analysts alone. AI offers the ability to process this data at scale, identify emerging trends, and flag individuals or groups exhibiting behaviors that statistically correlate with a heightened risk of violence [1].</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t about thought crime. It&rsquo;s about identifying behavioral indicators – repeated calls for violence, documented associations with known extremist groups, and demonstrable planning of illegal activities – that, when combined, paint a picture of potential risk. This data-driven approach can potentially provide law enforcement with crucial lead time to intervene, potentially preventing tragedies.</p><p><strong>Addressing the Ethical Minefield: Algorithmic Bias and Misidentification</strong></p><p>The concerns regarding algorithmic bias and the potential for misidentification are legitimate and must be addressed head-on. AI models are trained on data, and if that data reflects existing societal biases, the resulting AI will perpetuate and amplify those biases [2]. This necessitates a multi-pronged approach:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Diversification and Auditing:</strong> Training data must be carefully curated to ensure representation from diverse communities and viewpoints. Regular audits, utilizing independent third-party organizations, are crucial to identify and mitigate biases within the algorithms [3].</li><li><strong>Explainable AI (XAI):</strong> &ldquo;Black box&rdquo; AI systems are unacceptable. We need AI models that can explain their reasoning and provide transparent justifications for their risk assessments. This allows for human oversight and the ability to challenge potentially inaccurate or biased conclusions.</li><li><strong>Human-in-the-Loop Systems:</strong> AI should not be a replacement for human judgment, but a tool to augment it. Trained professionals, not algorithms, should make the final decisions about intervention, based on the totality of available evidence, including the AI&rsquo;s assessment.</li></ul><p><strong>Safeguards and Accountability: Building a Responsible Framework</strong></p><p>The deployment of AI for proactive identification of political violence requires a robust regulatory framework that prioritizes accountability and protects civil liberties. This framework should include:</p><ul><li><strong>Clear Legal Definitions:</strong> Precise definitions of what constitutes &ldquo;political violence&rdquo; and the specific behaviors that trigger AI analysis are crucial to prevent mission creep and protect legitimate political dissent.</li><li><strong>Independent Oversight:</strong> An independent body should be established to oversee the development, deployment, and evaluation of these AI systems. This body should have the authority to audit algorithms, investigate complaints, and enforce compliance with ethical guidelines.</li><li><strong>Transparency and Due Process:</strong> Individuals flagged by AI systems should have the right to access the information used to make that assessment and to challenge its accuracy. Clear procedures for appeal and redress must be established.</li></ul><p><strong>Innovation and Continuous Improvement: The Scientific Method in Action</strong></p><p>The development and deployment of AI for preventing political violence is not a static process, but a continuous cycle of experimentation, evaluation, and refinement. We must embrace the scientific method, rigorously testing the effectiveness of these systems, identifying areas for improvement, and adapting our approach based on the evidence.</p><p>This includes tracking metrics related to:</p><ul><li><strong>Precision and Recall:</strong> How accurately does the AI identify potential threats, and what percentage of actual threats does it miss?</li><li><strong>False Positive Rate:</strong> How often does the AI incorrectly flag individuals or groups as potential threats?</li><li><strong>Impact on Civil Liberties:</strong> What is the impact of the AI&rsquo;s deployment on freedom of expression and political participation?</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion: A Measured and Data-Driven Path Forward</strong></p><p>AI-driven proactive identification of potential acts of political violence is not a panacea, nor is it without risk. However, dismissing its potential outright would be a dereliction of our duty to explore all possible solutions to a pressing societal problem. By embracing a data-driven approach, prioritizing transparency and accountability, and continuously refining our methods through rigorous scientific evaluation, we can harness the power of AI to mitigate the threat of political violence while safeguarding fundamental rights and freedoms.

The latest marvel dangled before us is AI-driven proactive identification of potential acts of political violence. The claim? To use algorithms to sift through the digital haystack and pluck out the individuals most likely to commit acts of violence, preventing tragedy before it strikes. The question, however, is a fundamental one: at what cost?</p><p><strong>The Siren Song of Security</strong></p><p>No right-thinking American wants to see political violence erupt in our streets. The chaos, the destruction, and the erosion of civil order are anathema to a free and prosperous society. Proponents of AI-driven policing argue that these systems offer a powerful new tool to protect our communities. They claim that these algorithms can identify patterns and connections that human law enforcement might miss, enabling them to intervene early and prevent potentially devastating events. Who can argue with saving lives?</p><p>However, we must be wary of trading liberty for the illusion of security. As Benjamin Franklin famously said, &ldquo;Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.&rdquo; [Franklin, Benjamin. (1775). <em>Historical Review of Pennsylvania</em>.] This warning resonates strongly in the current context.</p><p><strong>The Perils of Predictive Policing</strong></p><p>The core problem lies in the very nature of prediction. AI algorithms are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the data reflects existing biases within our society, these biases will be amplified and perpetuated. This raises the specter of disproportionate targeting of marginalized communities or political opponents based on flawed algorithms. Imagine a system trained on data that unfairly associates certain political ideologies or demographics with violence. The result would be the chilling of legitimate political dissent, as individuals fear being flagged as potential threats simply for expressing unpopular opinions.</p><p>Furthermore, the very notion of &ldquo;pre-crime&rdquo; raises profound ethical questions. Do we really want to live in a society where individuals are punished or surveilled based on what they <em>might</em> do, rather than what they have <em>actually</em> done? The American justice system is predicated on the principle of &ldquo;innocent until proven guilty.&rdquo; Preemptive intervention based on AI predictions turns this principle on its head.</p><p><strong>Free Markets, Free Speech, and Individual Responsibility</strong></p><p>The conservative perspective emphasizes individual responsibility and limited government intervention. While we acknowledge the importance of maintaining order and preventing violence, we believe that the primary responsibility for one&rsquo;s actions lies with the individual. We must be cautious about empowering the state with tools that could be used to stifle free speech and infringe upon individual liberties.</p><p>Instead of relying solely on AI-driven surveillance, we should focus on strengthening the institutions that promote responsible citizenship and encourage peaceful dialogue. Robust debate, open communication, and a commitment to the rule of law are the best defenses against political violence. Furthermore, a free and unfettered market allows individuals to pursue their goals peacefully and productively, reducing the incentives for resorting to violence.</p><p><strong>Accountability and Transparency are Paramount</strong></p><p>If AI-driven policing is to be considered at all, it must be subject to rigorous oversight and transparency. The algorithms used must be publicly auditable to ensure they are not biased or discriminatory. Strong safeguards must be in place to prevent misuse and protect the privacy of individuals. There must be clear accountability for errors and misidentifications.</p><p>Ultimately, the question of AI-driven proactive identification of potential acts of political violence is a complex one with no easy answers. While the potential benefits of preventing violence are undeniable, the risks to our fundamental freedoms are equally significant. We must proceed with extreme caution, ensuring that any use of this technology is strictly limited, carefully monitored, and firmly grounded in the principles of individual liberty, free markets, and limited government intervention. The price of security should never be the erosion of the freedoms that make America exceptional.</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Progressive Voice</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>April 19, 2025 8:10 PM</span>

The specter of right-wing extremists storming capitols, fueled by misinformation and hateful rhetoric, is a chilling reminder of the fragility of our democracy. Yet, as we grapple with these anxieties, we must be vigilant against solutions that, however well-intentioned, pave the path to systemic oppression. The increasing use of AI to proactively identify potential acts of political violence, while marketed as a necessary precaution, is, in reality, a dangerous encroachment on our fundamental freedoms and a tool ripe for misuse.</p><p><strong>The Illusion of Objectivity: Exposing Algorithmic Bias</strong></p><p>Proponents of AI-driven prediction argue that these systems offer an objective and data-driven approach to threat assessment. But this is a dangerous myth. AI algorithms are trained on data, and data reflects the biases inherent within our society. If the data used to train these systems is skewed by historical prejudices against marginalized communities and political dissidents, the AI will perpetuate and amplify these biases. As Cathy O&rsquo;Neil warns in <em>Weapons of Math Destruction</em>, &ldquo;algorithms are opinions embedded in code.&rdquo; [1]</p><p>Imagine an AI trained on data that disproportionately flags Black Lives Matter activists or Indigenous land defenders as potential threats. This is not a hypothetical scenario. The very definition of &ldquo;political violence&rdquo; is inherently subjective and vulnerable to manipulation. Are we truly safeguarding democracy by labeling those who challenge the status quo as potential terrorists, while turning a blind eye to the far-right extremism that continues to fester online? This selective targeting serves only to silence dissent and perpetuate systemic inequality.</p><p><strong>Chilling Effect on Free Speech and Assembly</strong></p><p>The chilling effect of these AI systems is undeniable. Knowing that your online activity, your communication patterns, and even your social circles are being monitored and analyzed by the government will inevitably discourage individuals from expressing dissenting opinions or participating in political activism. As Shoshana Zuboff argues in <em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em>, this constant surveillance erodes individual autonomy and creates a society of self-censorship. [2]</p><p>Imagine a young activist afraid to organize a protest against a pipeline because they fear being flagged as a potential threat. Imagine a writer censoring their own criticism of government policies to avoid being targeted by AI surveillance. This is the reality we risk creating – a society where fear silences dissent and genuine political discourse is stifled.</p><p><strong>Accountability and Transparency: The Missing Pillars</strong></p><p>Even if we could somehow overcome the inherent biases within these AI systems, the lack of transparency and accountability surrounding their use is deeply troubling. How are these systems trained? What data is being used? What criteria are used to identify potential threats? Who is responsible for the inevitable misidentifications? These questions demand clear and transparent answers.</p><p>Without robust oversight and strict regulations, these systems become black boxes, operating with impunity and lacking any real accountability. The potential for abuse is immense. We must demand that government agencies utilizing these technologies be transparent about their methods and provide mechanisms for individuals to challenge their inclusion on these watchlists.</p><p><strong>The Path Forward: Addressing Root Causes, Not Suppressing Symptoms</strong></p><p>Instead of investing in these dystopian surveillance technologies, we should focus on addressing the root causes of political violence: inequality, social injustice, and the proliferation of hate speech. We need to invest in education, community development, and mental health services. We need to challenge the systemic injustices that fuel anger and resentment.</p><p>We must also aggressively combat the spread of misinformation and hate speech online, but this cannot come at the cost of silencing legitimate political dissent. We need to work with social media companies to develop responsible content moderation policies that protect free speech while addressing the dangers of extremism.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: A Choice Between Security and Justice</strong></p><p>The promise of preventing political violence is a powerful one, but we must not allow ourselves to be seduced by the illusion of technological solutions that erode our fundamental freedoms. AI-driven prediction of political violence is a dangerous path, one that threatens to exacerbate existing inequalities and stifle dissent. We must reject this false choice between security and liberty. A just society is a secure society. Let us focus on building that just society, not on creating a surveillance state that targets and silences those who dare to challenge the status quo. The future of our democracy depends on it.</p><p><strong>Citations:</strong></p><p>[1] O&rsquo;Neil, Cathy. <em>Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy</em>.

As a humanitarian aid worker, my primary concern rests with the well-being of individuals and communities. Therefore, any technology with the potential to both save lives and infringe upon fundamental freedoms requires careful and nuanced examination. While acknowledging the potential benefits of such systems, my perspective is grounded in the principles of human dignity, community ownership, and cultural understanding, emphasizing that preventative measures should never come at the cost of disproportionately harming vulnerable populations.</p><p><strong>The Potential for Harm and the Primacy of Human Well-being</strong></p><p>The core argument for AI-driven identification lies in the potential to prevent tragic acts of violence and protect innocent lives. The rise of online radicalization and the speed with which attacks can be planned and coordinated are valid concerns. However, the potential for harm inherent in these systems cannot be overlooked. AI algorithms are trained on data, and if that data reflects existing societal biases, the algorithms will perpetuate and even amplify those biases. This is particularly concerning when dealing with politically sensitive issues. Imagine an AI system trained on data that disproportionately associates certain ethnic groups or political ideologies with violence. The result could be the unjust targeting, surveillance, and even wrongful arrest of individuals based solely on their background or beliefs. [1]</p><p>Furthermore, the &ldquo;false positive&rdquo; rate – the rate at which individuals are incorrectly identified as potential threats – carries devastating consequences. Being wrongly labeled as a potential threat can lead to social stigma, economic hardship, and psychological distress, impacting individual well-being and fracturing communities. [2] The fear of being misidentified could also stifle freedom of expression and discourage participation in legitimate political discourse, undermining the very democratic processes these systems are intended to protect.</p><p><strong>Community Solutions and the Importance of Cultural Understanding</strong></p><p>From a humanitarian perspective, addressing the root causes of political violence requires engaging with communities and fostering inclusive solutions. Relying solely on AI-driven identification can create a climate of fear and distrust, potentially alienating the very communities that are most vital in preventing violence. [3]</p><p>Instead of relying solely on technological solutions, we must prioritize community-led initiatives that promote dialogue, understanding, and social cohesion. This includes investing in mental health services, education programs, and conflict resolution mechanisms that address the underlying factors contributing to radicalization and violence.</p><p>Furthermore, cultural understanding is paramount. What might be considered a threat in one cultural context could be perfectly acceptable in another. AI systems, without sufficient cultural sensitivity, risk misinterpreting behaviors and unjustly targeting individuals based on cultural misunderstandings. Building trust and fostering collaboration between law enforcement, social services, and community leaders is essential for effective prevention.</p><p><strong>Local Impact and the Need for Accountability</strong></p><p>Ultimately, the effectiveness of any preventative measure, including AI-driven identification, must be measured by its impact on the ground. Has it demonstrably reduced violence without disproportionately harming specific communities? Are the systems transparent and accountable? Do affected individuals have access to redress mechanisms if they are wrongly identified?</p><p>The opacity of AI algorithms makes it difficult to ensure fairness and accountability. It is crucial that these systems are designed with transparency in mind, allowing for independent audits and scrutiny. Furthermore, individuals who are wrongly identified as potential threats must have access to effective redress mechanisms to clear their names and seek compensation for any damages suffered.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: A Cautious and Human-Centered Approach</strong></p><p>While AI-driven identification of potential acts of political violence may offer the potential to prevent tragedies, its application demands a cautious and human-centered approach. The potential for bias, the risk of false positives, and the impact on civil liberties are serious concerns that must be addressed. Prioritizing human well-being, fostering community solutions, and promoting cultural understanding are essential safeguards. Only through a balanced and ethical approach can we hope to harness the potential benefits of AI while protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of all individuals.</p><p><strong>Citations</strong></p><p>[1] O’Neil, Cathy. <em>Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy</em>.

The debate surrounding AI-driven proactive identification of potential acts of violence is a critical one, forcing us to confront the intersection of technological innovation, public safety, and fundamental freedoms. As a data-driven observer, I believe the question isn&rsquo;t whether we should explore this technology, but <em>how</em> we can responsibly harness its power while mitigating its inherent risks.</p><p><strong>The Data-Driven Case for Proactive Intervention:</strong></p><p>The core argument for using AI in this space rests on the power of predictive analytics. In an era defined by information overload, humans alone are often insufficient to sift through the vast ocean of data and identify emergent threats. AI, with its ability to process massive datasets and identify subtle patterns, offers a powerful tool for early detection.</p><ul><li><strong>Early Warning Systems:</strong> Algorithms can analyze social media activity, online forums, communication patterns, and other data points to identify individuals exhibiting signs of radicalization or intent to commit violence. This offers the potential for early intervention, potentially diverting individuals from a path to violence through social services or mental health support (Lum, K., & Isaac, A. J. (2016). To predict and serve?. <em>Significance, 13</em>(5), 14-19.).</li><li><strong>Resource Optimization:</strong> Law enforcement agencies can use predictive models to allocate resources more efficiently, focusing on areas and individuals identified as high-risk. This allows for a more targeted and proactive approach to preventing violence, rather than relying solely on reactive measures.</li><li><strong>Data-Driven Threat Assessment:</strong> By incorporating objective data into threat assessments, AI can help reduce biases that might inadvertently influence human judgement. This promotes a more equitable and objective approach to identifying potential threats.</li></ul><p>The rise of online radicalization and the digital echo chambers it creates necessitate technological solutions. Individuals are increasingly isolated and exposed to extremist ideologies online, making early detection and intervention paramount. Waiting for an act of violence to occur before taking action is simply unacceptable when data-driven tools offer the potential to prevent such tragedies.</p><p><strong>Addressing the Concerns: Algorithmic Bias and Civil Liberties:</strong></p><p>Despite the potential benefits, the concerns raised by critics are valid and must be addressed with rigor and transparency. The potential for algorithmic bias and the erosion of civil liberties are serious risks that cannot be ignored.</p><ul><li><strong>Data Bias and Fairness:</strong> AI models are trained on historical data, which often reflects existing societal biases. This can lead to algorithms that disproportionately target marginalized communities, perpetuating existing inequalities. To mitigate this risk, rigorous testing and validation are crucial. Datasets must be carefully curated to ensure representativeness and mitigate bias. Furthermore, algorithms should be regularly audited to identify and correct any discriminatory outcomes (O&rsquo;Neil, C. (2016). <em>Weapons of math destruction: How big data increases inequality and threatens democracy</em>. Crown.).</li><li><strong>Transparency and Accountability:</strong> The &ldquo;black box&rdquo; nature of some AI algorithms makes it difficult to understand how they arrive at their conclusions. This lack of transparency can erode trust and make it difficult to hold developers and implementers accountable. Explainable AI (XAI) is a critical area of research that seeks to develop algorithms that are more transparent and interpretable (Adadi, A., & Berrada, M. (2018). Peeking inside the black-box: Explainable AI (XAI) and its applications. <em>IEEE Access, 6</em>, 52138-52160.).</li><li><strong>Due Process and Oversight:</strong> The use of AI to identify potential threats must be subject to strict legal and ethical oversight. Clear guidelines and regulations are needed to ensure that individuals are not unfairly targeted or subjected to unwarranted surveillance. Due process protections, including the right to challenge AI-based assessments, are essential.</li></ul><p><strong>A Path Forward: Data Ethics and Responsible Innovation:</strong></p><p>The solution lies not in abandoning the pursuit of AI-driven threat detection, but in embracing a responsible and ethical approach to its development and deployment. This requires a commitment to:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Ethics:</strong> Implementing robust data governance policies that prioritize privacy, security, and fairness.</li><li><strong>Algorithmic Auditing:</strong> Regularly auditing AI models to identify and correct biases and ensure accountability.</li><li><strong>Transparency and Explainability:</strong> Developing AI algorithms that are transparent and interpretable, allowing for greater understanding and oversight.</li><li><strong>Collaboration and Dialogue:</strong> Fostering open dialogue between technologists, policymakers, and civil society organizations to ensure that AI is used in a way that protects both security and freedom.</li></ul><p>The promise of AI to enhance public safety is undeniable. However, it is our responsibility as technologists and data scientists to ensure that this power is wielded ethically and responsibly. By embracing data ethics, prioritizing transparency, and fostering open dialogue, we can harness the power of AI to prevent violence while safeguarding fundamental freedoms. The alternative – remaining passive in the face of evolving threats – is simply unacceptable. The data demands a proactive, yet cautious, approach.</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Conservative Voice</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>April 16, 2025 2:24 AM</span>

From Portland to Washington D.C., we&rsquo;ve witnessed firsthand the destructive power of ideological fervor unleashed. It&rsquo;s understandable that many are searching for solutions, grasping at the promise of technology to preemptively identify and thwart potential threats. The question, however, isn&rsquo;t <em>whether</em> we want to prevent violence, but <em>at what cost</em>? The burgeoning field of AI-driven proactive identification of potential acts of political violence demands careful consideration, lest we sacrifice the very liberties we seek to protect on the altar of security.</p><p><strong>The Appeal of Prevention:</strong></p><p>There’s a certain logic to the argument for leveraging AI in this arena. In today’s interconnected world, online radicalization can occur with alarming speed. Individuals, isolated and vulnerable, can be swept away by extremist ideologies and incited to violence through the insidious power of online echo chambers (Berger, 2018). Proponents argue that AI, equipped with its ability to analyze vast datasets of online activity, can detect these warning signs and provide authorities with the information necessary to intervene before tragedy strikes. Think of it as a sophisticated early warning system, identifying potential threats before they metastasize into real-world violence.</p><p>Furthermore, the argument extends beyond large-scale acts of terrorism or insurrection. It encompasses smaller acts of vandalism, intimidation, and harassment that, while individually less impactful, contribute to a climate of fear and undermine public discourse. AI, theoretically, could identify individuals likely to engage in these activities and allow law enforcement to address the problem before it escalates.</p><p><strong>The Peril of Algorithmic Overreach:</strong></p><p>However, the promise of a safer society must be weighed against the very real dangers to individual liberty. As conservatives, we understand that government power, even when wielded with good intentions, is inherently prone to abuse. The notion of a government algorithm predicting future criminal behavior should send shivers down the spine of every patriot who values freedom.</p><p>One of the most pressing concerns is the potential for bias within these AI systems. These algorithms are trained on historical data, and if that data reflects existing societal biases – for example, disproportionate surveillance of minority communities – then the AI will inevitably perpetuate those biases, potentially targeting individuals solely based on their race, religion, or political affiliation (O&rsquo;Neil, 2016). Imagine a system that flags individuals based on their online expression of conservative viewpoints or their affiliation with certain political organizations. This is not the America we want; it’s a slippery slope towards a chilling effect on free speech and assembly.</p><p>Furthermore, the opaqueness of AI algorithms makes it difficult to ensure accountability. Who is responsible when the algorithm flags an innocent individual, leading to unwarranted surveillance, harassment, or even wrongful arrest? How can we be sure that the data used to train the algorithm is accurate and unbiased? These are questions that must be answered before we unleash this technology on the public.</p><p><strong>A Path Forward: Balancing Security and Liberty:</strong></p><p>Ultimately, the question is not whether we should use technology to combat political violence, but how. A responsible approach requires a commitment to transparency, accountability, and the protection of individual rights.</p><p>Firstly, any AI system used for proactive identification must be subject to rigorous independent oversight to ensure fairness and accuracy. Secondly, the data used to train these algorithms must be carefully vetted to eliminate bias. And finally, safeguards must be in place to protect the privacy and free speech rights of individuals who are flagged by the system.</p><p>We must remember that true security comes not from technological solutions alone, but from a society that values individual liberty, promotes free expression, and upholds the rule of law. While the allure of AI-driven prevention is strong, we must tread carefully, lest we create a cure that is worse than the disease. Let us be vigilant against violence, but equally vigilant against the erosion of our fundamental freedoms.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>Berger, J. M. (2018). <em>Extremism</em>.

But are we willing to hand the keys to our freedoms over to algorithms promising to deliver this utopian vision? The emerging use of AI to proactively identify individuals and groups deemed &ldquo;likely&rdquo; to commit acts of political violence raises fundamental questions about justice, equity, and the very nature of a free society. While proponents tout the potential to prevent tragedies, a closer examination reveals a dangerous slide towards systemic oppression, disproportionately targeting marginalized communities and stifling dissent.</p><p><strong>The Illusion of Objective Prediction:</strong></p><p>Let&rsquo;s be clear: predictive policing isn&rsquo;t new. But the scale and opacity offered by AI take the existing problems of bias and discrimination to a terrifying new level. Proponents argue these systems are objective, using data to identify warning signs. However, the reality is that AI algorithms are trained on <em>historical data</em>, data inherently reflecting existing societal biases. As Cathy O&rsquo;Neil so powerfully argues in <em>Weapons of Math Destruction</em>, algorithms are often &ldquo;opinions embedded in code&rdquo; [1]. Training an AI on data reflecting past discriminatory practices – say, historical policing patterns that disproportionately target Black communities – will inevitably lead to the AI perpetuating and even amplifying those biases.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t just hypothetical. Research has consistently demonstrated how AI systems used in criminal justice contexts exhibit racial bias [2, 3]. Applying these same flawed methodologies to predict <em>political</em> violence is a recipe for disaster. Imagine an AI trained on data that conflates activism for racial justice with &ldquo;extremism,&rdquo; or that flags individuals expressing anti-establishment sentiments online as potential threats. The result would be a chilling effect on legitimate political expression and a further erosion of trust between communities and law enforcement.</p><p><strong>Chilling Free Speech and Targeting Dissent:</strong></p><p>The First Amendment guarantees the right to freedom of speech and assembly. These are not mere privileges; they are fundamental pillars of a functioning democracy. AI-driven prediction of political violence directly threatens these rights. The very act of being flagged as a potential threat, based on algorithmically determined “risk factors,” could lead to surveillance, harassment, and even pre-emptive intervention by law enforcement. This chilling effect will disproportionately impact marginalized communities and activists who are already subjected to heightened scrutiny and surveillance. Who decides what constitutes a &ldquo;warning sign&rdquo;? What safeguards are in place to prevent the suppression of legitimate dissent? The answers to these questions remain woefully inadequate.</p><p>The risk extends beyond large-scale protests. Consider the implications for online activism and community organizing. Individuals expressing dissenting opinions, or even simply sharing information deemed &ldquo;radical&rdquo; by the algorithm, could be flagged as potential threats, effectively silencing their voices and limiting their ability to participate in the democratic process. This is not about preventing violence; it&rsquo;s about controlling the narrative and suppressing dissent.</p><p><strong>The Need for Systemic Change, Not Algorithmic Quick Fixes:</strong></p><p>Focusing on AI-driven prediction of political violence is a dangerous distraction from the root causes of violence in our society. Inequality, systemic racism, economic disenfranchisement, and a lack of access to mental health resources are just some of the factors that contribute to a climate of anger and despair that can, in some cases, lead to violence. Instead of investing in surveillance technologies that perpetuate inequality, we need to address these underlying issues through systemic change.</p><p>We need to invest in community-led initiatives that promote healing and reconciliation. We need to ensure equitable access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunity for all. And we need to create a political system that is responsive to the needs of all its citizens, not just the wealthy and powerful.</p><p><strong>Protecting Freedom Requires Vigilance and Resistance:</strong></p><p>The lure of a perfectly safe society, free from political violence, is a dangerous fantasy. The pursuit of this fantasy through AI-driven prediction threatens to undermine the very principles of freedom and justice that we claim to uphold. We must resist the temptation to sacrifice our civil liberties at the altar of &ldquo;security.&rdquo; We must demand transparency and accountability from those who develop and deploy these technologies. And we must continue to fight for a more just and equitable society where all voices can be heard, and where violence is addressed through systemic change, not algorithmic overreach.
