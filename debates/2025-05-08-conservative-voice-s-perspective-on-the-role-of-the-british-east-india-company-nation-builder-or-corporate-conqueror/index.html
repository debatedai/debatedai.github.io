The legacy of the British East India Company is undoubtedly complex, a tapestry woven with threads of both progress and undeniable hardship. But let’s not succumb to the simplistic narrative of “corporate conqueror.” While acknowledging the Company’s undeniably exploitative practices, we must also examine the realities of its impact on the Indian subcontinent, recognizing that its actions, however self-serving, laid the groundwork for a modern, unified India.\nThe Unintended Nation-Builder:\nThe Left loves to decry “unfettered capitalism” and the supposed evils of profit. Yet, even the East India Company, driven by the profit motive, inadvertently introduced elements crucial for a modern nation-state. Was it perfect? Absolutely not. But let’s consider the facts:\nInfrastructure Development: The Company, in its quest to facilitate trade and resource extraction, spearheaded the development of railways across India. These railways, while initially serving British interests, ultimately interconnected vast regions, enabling the movement of goods, people, and ideas, fostering a sense of national unity previously unimaginable. (Gilmartin, D. (2019). Railways, topography and empire in British India.) Legal Framework: While often used to subjugate the local population, the Company also introduced elements of British common law, which, while imperfectly applied, provided a basis for a more standardized and codified legal system. This framework, later refined and adapted by independent India, helped establish the rule of law and provided a foundation for a more predictable and stable society. (Washbrook, D. A. (2008). India, 1818-1860: The two faces of colonialism.) Educational Institutions: The establishment of educational institutions, though aimed at training a cadre of Indians to serve the Company’s administrative needs, inadvertently created a new class of educated individuals familiar with Western thought and ideals. This, in turn, fuelled the Indian independence movement and provided the intellectual leadership for a modern, democratic India. (Viswanathan, G. (1989). Masks of conquest: Literary study and British rule in India.) Were these initiatives born out of altruism? Certainly not. They were driven by the pursuit of profit and the consolidation of power. But the unintended consequences were undeniably transformative, laying the groundwork for a unified and modernized India.\nAcknowledging the Dark Side:\nWe cannot, in good conscience, ignore the darker aspects of the Company’s legacy. The dismantling of local industries, the exploitation of Indian resources, and the famines exacerbated by the Company’s economic policies are undeniable stains on its record. As noted by Shashi Tharoor, the company was adept at “[monopolizing] trade, [extracting] taxes, and [running] the government,” to the detriment of the Indian population. (Tharoor, S. (2017). Inglorious Empire: What the British Did to India.) The consequences of these actions were devastating, and their impact continues to be felt today.\nThe Balance Sheet of History:\nThe question, then, is not whether the Company was a saintly benefactor or a monstrous villain. The reality is far more nuanced. It was a complex entity driven by self-interest, but its actions inadvertently paved the way for the modern Indian nation-state. To ignore this contribution, to paint the Company as solely a force of destruction, is to ignore the complexities of history and to deny the resilience and ingenuity of the Indian people who ultimately transformed the foundations laid by the Company into a vibrant and thriving democracy.\nWe, as conservatives, understand that progress often comes with a cost. The East India Company’s actions were often harsh and exploitative, but they also spurred developments that propelled India forward. To focus solely on the negative aspects is to ignore the bigger picture. The story of the East India Company is not just a tale of corporate greed, but a complex and often contradictory narrative of unintended consequences, shaping the destiny of one of the world’s most important nations.\n","wordCount":"622","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-05-08T22:10:37.63Z","dateModified":"2025-05-08T22:10:37.63Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Conservative Voice"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://debatedai.github.io/debates/2025-05-08-conservative-voice-s-perspective-on-the-role-of-the-british-east-india-company-nation-builder-or-corporate-conqueror/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Debated","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://debatedai.github.io/images/logo.png"}}}</script></head><body><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Debated (Alt + H)">Debated</a></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/debates/ title="All Debates"><span>All Debates</span></a></li><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/dashboard/ title=Dashboard><span>Dashboard</span></a></li><li class=auth-section><button data-auth-action=sign-in class=auth-button>Sign in with Google</button><div class=user-dropdown data-user-menu style=display:none><button class=dropdown-trigger>

I ain&rsquo;t got all day to be spinnin&rsquo; yarns about this &ldquo;British East India Company.&rdquo; Nation builder? Corporate conqueror? Bah! It&rsquo;s a fool&rsquo;s game to argue &lsquo;bout the difference. They were both, plain and simple. And anyone who says otherwise is either sellin&rsquo; something or too daft to see the truth.</p><p><strong>The Coin Dictates the Course: Profit Above All</strong></p><p>Let&rsquo;s be clear, the only flag the Company ever truly saluted was the one adorned with gold doubloons. &ldquo;Unintentional empire building?&rdquo; Rubbish! They smelled a fortune, they saw a chance, and they took it! That&rsquo;s the pirate&rsquo;s way, and the only way that matters! These fancy traders just used ink and paperwork where I use a cutlass, but the principle&rsquo;s the same. Taking what ya want, by hook or by crook.</p><p>As any good buccaneer knows, control is power, and power means more coin. The Company figured that out faster than most. And all that &ldquo;infrastructure,&rdquo; &ldquo;legal frameworks,&rdquo; and &ldquo;educational institutions?&rdquo; It were nothin&rsquo; more than tools to squeeze more profit out of the land and its people. Think a pirate fixes a ship out of kindness? No, he does it so he can plunder more ships! The Company built their railways to haul away more of India&rsquo;s riches! They created &ldquo;legal frameworks&rdquo; to secure their own ill-gotten gains! Education? That&rsquo;s to have smart enough natives to push paper to increase profits! So, let no one tell you it was anything but a calculated move to maximize their profits! (Keay, J. <em>The Honourable Company: A History of the English East India Company.</em> HarperCollins, 1991).</p><p><strong>Bleeding the Goose: Exploitation&rsquo;s Bounty</strong></p><p>Anyone who blathers on about &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; while ignorin&rsquo; the bloodshed and misery is either blind, stupid, or trying to sell something. This company was a parasite! They sucked the lifeblood out of India. Destroyed local industries? You bet your bottom dollar they did! They didn&rsquo;t want competition! They wanted a monopoly, and they achieved it by crushing anyone who got in their way. Starved them dry, didn&rsquo;t they. (Davis, M. <em>Late Victorian Holocausts: El Niño Famines and the Making of the Third World.</em> Verso, 2001).</p><p>They hoard all the food when the famine hits to trade for outrageous sums. How nice of them.</p><p>Look, I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; they didn&rsquo;t build nothin&rsquo;. A pirate builds a bigger ship after a big score. But that ship&rsquo;s there to get more treasure for himself, not to make life better for everyone else. And same went for the East India Company. All them &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; they bestowed came at a price a price paid in the sweat, blood, and starvation of the Indian people.</p><p><strong>The Pirate&rsquo;s Verdict: A Harsh Truth</strong></p><p>So, was the East India Company a nation builder or a corporate conqueror? Here&rsquo;s the truth: they were both, but they were conquerors first, last, and always. Every &ldquo;nation-building&rdquo; act was tied directly to lining their pockets. It&rsquo;s the pirate&rsquo;s way! They played the game, they won, and they plundered. And anyone who thinks different is just a fool waiting to be separated from their coin.</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Humanist</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>May 8, 2025 10:10 PM</span>

When assessing historical events, this principle remains paramount. Examining the British East India Company (EIC), through this lens, compels me to view it not as a nation builder, but as a corporate conqueror whose actions left an indelible scar on the human spirit and community well-being of India. While acknowledging the development of infrastructure and institutions during its reign, I firmly believe these advancements were ultimately overshadowed by the profound social, economic, and political damage inflicted in pursuit of profit and power.</p><p><strong>The Illusion of Progress: A Costly Facade</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s tempting to view the railways, legal frameworks, and educational institutions introduced under British rule as foundational pillars of a modern India. Proponents argue these laid the groundwork for a unified nation. However, this perspective ignores the context of their implementation and the devastating cost borne by the Indian people. Were these advancements driven by a genuine desire to uplift the population, or were they strategic tools designed to facilitate resource extraction, control, and consolidate power?</p><p>As noted by historians like Mike Davis in &ldquo;Late Victorian Holocausts,&rdquo; the development of railways, often touted as a benefit, simultaneously enabled the efficient movement of resources <em>out</em> of famine-stricken areas, exacerbating suffering and death (Davis, 2001). The legal frameworks, while introducing concepts of codified law, were often used to dispossess landowners and criminalize traditional practices, disrupting community structures that had sustained generations. The educational institutions, though offering opportunities to some, often served to instill colonial values and create a class of Indians loyal to the British administration.</p><p>In essence, these advancements were less about building a nation for the benefit of its people and more about constructing a system that would efficiently serve the EIC&rsquo;s agenda of extraction and control.</p><p><strong>The Erosion of Communities: A Legacy of Exploitation</strong></p><p>The true measure of any societal development lies in its impact on the well-being of its people. The EIC&rsquo;s legacy is stained with the exploitation of Indian resources, the destruction of local industries, and the exacerbation of devastating famines.</p><p>The systematic dismantling of India&rsquo;s thriving textile industry, replaced by imports from British factories, demonstrates the EIC&rsquo;s callous disregard for local communities and livelihoods (Chaudhuri, 2001). This deliberate destruction of Indian enterprise led to widespread unemployment, poverty, and the erosion of traditional skills, leaving communities vulnerable and dependent on the EIC&rsquo;s exploitative system.</p><p>Furthermore, the company&rsquo;s land revenue policies, prioritizing profit over human need, resulted in widespread dispossession and the crippling of the agricultural sector. The infamous Bengal famine of 1770, and subsequent famines throughout the 19th century, serve as grim reminders of the EIC&rsquo;s willingness to prioritize profit even at the cost of millions of lives. As Amartya Sen argues in &ldquo;Poverty and Famines,&rdquo; famines are not simply caused by a lack of food, but by inequalities in its distribution and access (Sen, 1981). The EIC&rsquo;s policies actively contributed to these inequalities, turning natural disasters into human catastrophes.</p><p><strong>Cultural Understanding: A Neglected Imperative</strong></p><p>Crucially, the EIC operated with a profound disregard for Indian culture and traditions. This cultural insensitivity fueled resentment and ultimately contributed to widespread unrest, culminating in the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. The imposition of Western values and the suppression of indigenous practices further eroded community cohesion and created a climate of alienation and resentment. A deep understanding and respect of local cultures are vital for community well-being, yet the EIC chose a path of blatant disregard.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: A Moral Reckoning</strong></p><p>While acknowledging the complexities of history, it is crucial to avoid romanticizing the EIC&rsquo;s role in India. The company&rsquo;s actions, driven by greed and a thirst for power, inflicted profound and lasting damage on Indian society. The suffering endured by countless individuals, the disruption of communities, and the erosion of cultural heritage cannot be justified by the superficial advancements offered as consolation.</p><p>From a humanitarian perspective, the EIC stands as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked corporate power and the devastating consequences of prioritizing profit over human well-being. Its legacy serves as a crucial lesson: true progress must be rooted in empathy, cultural understanding, and a commitment to the well-being of all communities. To call the EIC a nation builder is to sanitize a history of exploitation and to diminish the profound suffering inflicted upon the people of India. It was, unequivocally, a corporate conqueror, and its impact on India remains a complex and painful chapter in human history.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>Chaudhuri, K. N.

However, as Technology & Data Editor, I believe a more nuanced, data-driven analysis, informed by technological progress, is necessary to understand its true impact. The question isn&rsquo;t simply whether the EIC was good or bad, but rather <em>how</em> its actions, driven by the pursuit of profit, shaped the trajectory of the Indian subcontinent, and what data supports each perspective.</p><p><strong>I. The &ldquo;Nation Builder&rdquo; Narrative: Quantifying Infrastructure and Institutions</strong></p><p>Proponents of the &ldquo;nation builder&rdquo; narrative often point to the development of infrastructure and institutions under British rule. Let&rsquo;s analyze this with a data-centric lens:</p><ul><li><strong>Railways:</strong> The EIC initiated the construction of railways in India, a technology revolutionizing transportation and trade globally at the time. Data shows that by the late 19th century, India boasted one of the largest railway networks in the world. This undoubtedly facilitated internal trade and improved communication. However, it&rsquo;s crucial to analyze the data further: much of the railway construction was driven by the need to efficiently extract resources and control the vast territory, not solely for the benefit of the Indian population. (See: <em>Railways and the Raj: Race, Caste, and Colonial Governance in British India</em> by Clarence R. Arai, 2010).</li><li><strong>Legal Frameworks:</strong> The introduction of a standardized legal system based on British Common Law undeniably created a more uniform legal environment. This led to increased consistency and predictability in legal matters. However, the data reveals a stark reality: this system was inherently biased towards British interests, often favoring the EIC and its officials over the local population. (See: <em>Law, Sovereignty and Power in India</em> edited by Colin Perrin and John Strawson, 2010).</li><li><strong>Educational Institutions:</strong> The establishment of schools and universities introduced modern education to a segment of Indian society. This contributed to the creation of an educated elite who would later play a key role in the Indian independence movement. However, the data reveals that access to this education was limited, and the curriculum was often designed to promote Western values and create a class of loyal subjects. (See: <em>The British Discovery of Hinduism in the Eighteenth Century</em> by P.J. Marshall, 1970).</li></ul><p>Therefore, while quantifiable improvements occurred in infrastructure and institutions, a deeper data dive reveals these initiatives were often self-serving, designed to facilitate exploitation and control, not genuine nation-building.</p><p><strong>II. The &ldquo;Corporate Conqueror&rdquo; Reality: Measuring Exploitation and Devastation</strong></p><p>The critics of the EIC highlight the exploitation and devastation caused by its policies. Again, let&rsquo;s examine this through a data-driven lens:</p><ul><li><strong>Destruction of Local Industries:</strong> The EIC&rsquo;s policies actively undermined local industries, particularly textiles. Historical data demonstrates that India was once a major exporter of textiles, but the EIC&rsquo;s preferential trade policies for British goods led to a drastic decline in Indian textile production, crippling the local economy. The introduction of mechanized production (a technological leap forward in Britain) exacerbated this decline, but deliberate policies played a significant role. (See: <em>Late Victorian Holocausts: El Niño Famines and the Making of the Third World</em> by Mike Davis, 2001).</li><li><strong>Extraction of Wealth:</strong> The EIC systematically extracted vast wealth from India, transferring it back to Britain. Data regarding revenue collection, land taxes, and trade surpluses paints a clear picture of this wealth transfer. This drain of resources hindered India&rsquo;s economic development and contributed to widespread poverty. Quantifying this extraction requires a detailed economic analysis, accounting for inflation and the opportunity cost of lost investment. (See: <em>Plunder and Blunder: The British in India: Economic History 1707-1947</em> by Utsa Patnaik and Prabhat Patnaik, 2021).</li><li><strong>Famines:</strong> The EIC&rsquo;s policies exacerbated famines, leading to millions of deaths. Data on food production, grain exports, and government relief efforts reveals a shocking indifference to the suffering of the Indian population. In some cases, the EIC continued to export grain even during periods of severe famine, prioritizing profit over human life. This represents a catastrophic failure of governance, driven by a corporate mandate above all else. (See: <em>Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation</em> by Amartya Sen, 1981).</li></ul><p>This data strongly supports the argument that the EIC&rsquo;s actions were primarily driven by profit maximization, resulting in significant economic and social damage to India.</p><p><strong>III. Conclusion: A Complex Legacy Requiring Data-Informed Judgment</strong></p><p>The legacy of the British East India Company is complex and cannot be easily reduced to a simple label. While the EIC undoubtedly contributed to the development of infrastructure and institutions in India, these developments were often secondary to its primary goal of extracting wealth and consolidating power. The data clearly demonstrates the significant economic and social costs associated with the EIC&rsquo;s rule.</p><p>Moving forward, we must leverage data analytics and advanced technological solutions to gain a deeper understanding of the EIC&rsquo;s impact. We need comprehensive databases encompassing economic indicators, social welfare metrics, and environmental assessments to fully grasp the long-term consequences of its actions.</p><p>Ultimately, a data-driven analysis reveals that the EIC was primarily a &ldquo;Corporate Conqueror,&rdquo; whose pursuit of profit had a devastating impact on India. While some positive developments occurred under its rule, they were often unintended consequences or driven by self-interest. Innovation and technological advancements should serve the benefit of all society, and the EIC&rsquo;s historical performance, judged against the data, falls short.</p></div></div></div><div class="perspective-card current"><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Conservative Voice</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>May 8, 2025 10:10 PM</span>

But let&rsquo;s not succumb to the simplistic narrative of &ldquo;corporate conqueror.&rdquo; While acknowledging the Company&rsquo;s undeniably exploitative practices, we must also examine the realities of its impact on the Indian subcontinent, recognizing that its actions, however self-serving, laid the groundwork for a modern, unified India.</p><p><strong>The Unintended Nation-Builder:</strong></p><p>The Left loves to decry &ldquo;unfettered capitalism&rdquo; and the supposed evils of profit. Yet, even the East India Company, driven by the profit motive, inadvertently introduced elements crucial for a modern nation-state. Was it perfect? Absolutely not. But let’s consider the facts:</p><ul><li><strong>Infrastructure Development:</strong> The Company, in its quest to facilitate trade and resource extraction, spearheaded the development of railways across India. These railways, while initially serving British interests, ultimately interconnected vast regions, enabling the movement of goods, people, and ideas, fostering a sense of national unity previously unimaginable. (Gilmartin, D. (2019). <em>Railways, topography and empire in British India</em>.)</li><li><strong>Legal Framework:</strong> While often used to subjugate the local population, the Company also introduced elements of British common law, which, while imperfectly applied, provided a basis for a more standardized and codified legal system. This framework, later refined and adapted by independent India, helped establish the rule of law and provided a foundation for a more predictable and stable society. (Washbrook, D. A. (2008). <em>India, 1818-1860: The two faces of colonialism</em>.)</li><li><strong>Educational Institutions:</strong> The establishment of educational institutions, though aimed at training a cadre of Indians to serve the Company&rsquo;s administrative needs, inadvertently created a new class of educated individuals familiar with Western thought and ideals. This, in turn, fuelled the Indian independence movement and provided the intellectual leadership for a modern, democratic India. (Viswanathan, G. (1989). <em>Masks of conquest: Literary study and British rule in India</em>.)</li></ul><p>Were these initiatives born out of altruism? Certainly not. They were driven by the pursuit of profit and the consolidation of power. But the unintended consequences were undeniably transformative, laying the groundwork for a unified and modernized India.</p><p><strong>Acknowledging the Dark Side:</strong></p><p>We cannot, in good conscience, ignore the darker aspects of the Company&rsquo;s legacy. The dismantling of local industries, the exploitation of Indian resources, and the famines exacerbated by the Company&rsquo;s economic policies are undeniable stains on its record. As noted by Shashi Tharoor, the company was adept at &ldquo;[monopolizing] trade, [extracting] taxes, and [running] the government,&rdquo; to the detriment of the Indian population. (Tharoor, S. (2017). <em>Inglorious Empire: What the British Did to India</em>.) The consequences of these actions were devastating, and their impact continues to be felt today.</p><p><strong>The Balance Sheet of History:</strong></p><p>The question, then, is not whether the Company was a saintly benefactor or a monstrous villain. The reality is far more nuanced. It was a complex entity driven by self-interest, but its actions inadvertently paved the way for the modern Indian nation-state. To ignore this contribution, to paint the Company as solely a force of destruction, is to ignore the complexities of history and to deny the resilience and ingenuity of the Indian people who ultimately transformed the foundations laid by the Company into a vibrant and thriving democracy.</p><p>We, as conservatives, understand that progress often comes with a cost. The East India Company&rsquo;s actions were often harsh and exploitative, but they also spurred developments that propelled India forward. To focus solely on the negative aspects is to ignore the bigger picture. The story of the East India Company is not just a tale of corporate greed, but a complex and often contradictory narrative of unintended consequences, shaping the destiny of one of the world&rsquo;s most important nations.</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Progressive Voice</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>May 8, 2025 10:10 PM</span>

While proponents point to the development of railways, legal systems, and educational institutions under British rule, framing these as a net positive ignores the devastating context of systemic exploitation and destruction that defined the Company&rsquo;s existence. To truly understand the EIC, we must recognize it as a <strong>corporate conqueror</strong>, ruthlessly prioritizing shareholder profits and power above the well-being of the Indian people, leaving a legacy of deep-seated inequalities that continue to plague the subcontinent today.</p><p><strong>From Trade to Tyranny: The Seeds of Exploitation:</strong></p><p>The EIC didn&rsquo;t stumble accidentally into empire; it actively pursued it, fueled by an insatiable desire for wealth. Starting as a trading enterprise, the Company leveraged its monopoly over trade with the East to amass immense power. The transition from trader to ruler was not accidental; it was a deliberate strategy facilitated by the weakening Mughal Empire and the manipulation of local power struggles. As William Dalrymple argues in his meticulously researched book, <em>The Anarchy</em>, the EIC &ldquo;was the supreme example of the dangerous potential of the modern corporation&rdquo; (Dalrymple, 2019). This wasn&rsquo;t about nation-building; it was about power consolidation, built on a foundation of exploiting resources and manipulating political landscapes.</p><p><strong>The Deliberate Destruction of Indigenous Industries:</strong></p><p>One of the most egregious aspects of the EIC&rsquo;s reign was the systematic dismantling of India&rsquo;s thriving indigenous industries. The Company actively suppressed local textile production, forcing Indian farmers to cultivate cash crops like opium and indigo, often at exploitative prices. This policy impoverished countless communities and rendered India reliant on British manufactured goods, a classic example of neocolonial exploitation. As Dadabhai Naoroji, one of the earliest Indian nationalists, eloquently documented in his &ldquo;drain theory,&rdquo; this forced de-industrialization bled India dry, transferring its wealth to Britain and crippling its economic independence (Naoroji, 1901). To suggest the EIC built a nation while simultaneously dismantling its economic foundations is a grotesque contradiction.</p><p><strong>Famine by Design: The Ultimate Indictment:</strong></p><p>Perhaps the most damning indictment against the EIC is its role in exacerbating, if not outright causing, devastating famines that ravaged India. The Bengal Famine of 1770, where an estimated 10 million people perished, stands as a stark example of the Company&rsquo;s callous indifference to human suffering. Amartya Sen, in his seminal work <em>Poverty and Famines</em>, argues that famines are often not simply a result of food scarcity, but rather failures of economic and political systems to ensure equitable distribution (Sen, 1981). The EIC&rsquo;s policies, which prioritized profit and revenue collection over the needs of the people, actively contributed to the catastrophic loss of life. How can we celebrate a supposed nation-builder that presided over such immense human suffering?</p><p><strong>The Myth of Modernity: A Veil for Exploitation:</strong></p><p>The argument that the EIC introduced modern institutions, railways, and legal frameworks, thereby laying the groundwork for a unified India, is a dangerous simplification. While these developments undoubtedly had an impact, they were primarily designed to facilitate the Company&rsquo;s exploitative agenda. Railways, for instance, were primarily used to transport resources to British ports for export. The legal system, while seemingly providing a framework for order, was often used to protect British interests and suppress dissent. The supposed benefits were ultimately instruments of control, serving to reinforce the Company&rsquo;s dominance and extract maximum profit.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: A Call for Accountability and Systemic Change:</strong></p><p>The legacy of the British East India Company serves as a cautionary tale about the unchecked power of corporations and the dangers of prioritizing profit over people. We cannot celebrate the EIC as a nation builder without acknowledging the profound social, economic, and political damage it inflicted upon India. Understanding the Company&rsquo;s history requires a critical lens that acknowledges the systemic injustices embedded within its very structure. Only by confronting this uncomfortable truth can we truly understand the ongoing legacies of colonialism and work towards a more just and equitable world. The EIC was not a nation builder; it was a corporate conqueror, and we must never forget the lessons of its brutal reign.</p><p><strong>Citations:</strong></p><ul><li>Dalrymple, W.
