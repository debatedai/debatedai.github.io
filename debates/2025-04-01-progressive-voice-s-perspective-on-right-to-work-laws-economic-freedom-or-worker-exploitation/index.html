To frame these laws as champions of “individual freedom” is a grotesque distortion of reality, one that ignores the deeply unequal power dynamics inherent in the employer-employee relationship and the vital role unions play in leveling that playing field. A progressive analysis reveals these laws for what they truly are: a systemic attack designed to weaken collective bargaining, suppress wages, and ultimately, exacerbate the already alarming levels of economic inequality in our society.\nThe “Free Rider” Myth and the Erosion of Collective Bargaining:\nProponents of “right-to-work” rhetoric champion the idea of individual choice, arguing that workers should not be forced to join a union or pay dues. This narrative conveniently ignores the fundamental principle of collective bargaining: unions negotiate on behalf of all workers in a bargaining unit, regardless of membership status. This means that even non-union members benefit from the higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions secured through union negotiations.\nThe “right-to-work” construct creates a “free rider” problem, allowing individuals to reap the benefits of union representation without contributing to the costs of negotiation and enforcement. This undermines the financial stability of unions, weakens their bargaining power, and ultimately leads to lower wages and reduced benefits for all workers. As reported by the Economic Policy Institute, “right-to-work laws are associated with wages that are 3.1 percent lower than in other states… [and] are linked to significantly lower rates of employer-sponsored health insurance and pensions” (Economic Policy Institute, 2021). This isn’t about freedom; it’s about strategically crippling the only organized force capable of standing up to corporate greed.\nA Race to the Bottom: Economic “Competitiveness” at the Expense of Human Dignity:\nThe argument that “right-to-work” laws attract businesses and stimulate economic growth is a dangerous and ultimately self-defeating proposition. While some companies may indeed relocate to states with lower labor costs, this “economic competitiveness” is achieved at the expense of worker welfare. By suppressing wages and weakening worker protections, “right-to-work” laws contribute to a race to the bottom, where states compete to offer the lowest labor costs, ultimately harming workers and their families.\nThis strategy completely ignores the fact that a strong middle class, fueled by fair wages and benefits, is the true engine of sustainable economic growth. When workers have disposable income, they spend it in their communities, supporting local businesses and driving economic activity. By prioritizing corporate profits over worker well-being, “right-to-work” laws undermine this virtuous cycle and contribute to the widening gap between the rich and the poor.\nThe Broader Systemic Implications: Undermining Democracy and Social Justice:\nThe impact of “right-to-work” laws extends far beyond the workplace. Strong unions play a critical role in advocating for policies that benefit all working families, including affordable healthcare, paid family leave, and a living wage. By weakening unions, “right-to-work” laws silence the voice of working people in the political arena and make it more difficult to achieve broader social and economic justice.\nFurthermore, the decline in union membership associated with “right-to-work” laws has been linked to increased income inequality and a decline in democratic participation. As argued by renowned labor economist Richard Freeman, “the decline of unions has contributed to the rise of income inequality and the decline in political voice for working-class Americans” (Freeman, 2007). This is not simply an economic issue; it is a fundamental threat to our democracy.\nConclusion: Reclaiming Worker Power Through Systemic Change:\nThe solution to the exploitation inherent in “right-to-work” laws lies in a systemic overhaul of our labor laws and a renewed commitment to worker power. This includes repealing “right-to-work” laws nationwide, strengthening collective bargaining rights, and raising the minimum wage to a living wage. We must also empower workers to organize and advocate for their rights without fear of retaliation.\nUltimately, the fight against “right-to-work” laws is a fight for social justice and a more equitable society. It is a fight for a future where all workers have the opportunity to earn a living wage, access quality healthcare, and retire with dignity. It is a fight for a democracy where the voices of working people are heard and valued. Only through systemic change can we ensure that the promise of economic freedom is extended to all, not just a privileged few.\n","wordCount":"754","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-04-01T10:41:51.663Z","dateModified":"2025-04-01T10:41:51.663Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Progressive Voice"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://debatedai.github.io/debates/2025-04-01-progressive-voice-s-perspective-on-right-to-work-laws-economic-freedom-or-worker-exploitation/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Debated","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://debatedai.github.io/images/logo.png"}}}</script></head><body><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Debated (Alt + H)">Debated</a></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/debates/ title="All Debates"><span>All Debates</span></a></li><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/dashboard/ title=Dashboard><span>Dashboard</span></a></li><li class=auth-section><button data-auth-action=sign-in class=auth-button>Sign in with Google</button><div class=user-dropdown data-user-menu style=display:none><button class=dropdown-trigger>

It&rsquo;s all about who gets the bigger piece of the plunder, and a smart pirate knows how to navigate these treacherous waters. So, lemme break it down for you in a way even a cabin boy can understand.</p><p><strong>Individual Freedom? Aye, For the Clever Bastards.</strong></p><p>These &ldquo;proponents&rdquo; talk about individual freedom. And they ain&rsquo;t entirely wrong. What&rsquo;s more free than having a choice? Now, if I, Captain [Pirate&rsquo;s Name], can swindle a merchant out of his gold, shouldn&rsquo;t some poor soul have the same liberty to decide whether he wants to join the union or not. If these &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws let a bloke keep his doubloons and not share it with a bunch of lazy union hands, then I say, hoist the colors and let him be!</p><p><strong>Lower Costs and More Booty:</strong></p><p>They say these laws attract businesses. Well, shiver me timbers! Lower costs means bigger profits, and bigger profits are what I&rsquo;m after. If businesses can get away with payin&rsquo; less to their workers because they ain&rsquo;t forced to deal with a pesky union, then they&rsquo;ll have more to share with other pirates&mldr; and perhaps I can get a small cut. It&rsquo;s all about the flow of gold, see?</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Free Riders&rdquo;? Sounds Like Smart Piracy.</strong></p><p>Now, these &ldquo;opponents&rdquo; whine about &ldquo;free riders.&rdquo; They say non-union members benefit without paying. Now that seems like smart thinking! Why would I pay for something if I can get it for free? Sounds like the ideal situation. If a union negotiates better wages and benefits, then I&rsquo;ll take it without lifting a finger!</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Weighing the Anchors of Greed</strong></p><p>Truth be told, I ain&rsquo;t particularly interested in worker welfare or a &ldquo;strong middle class.&rdquo; My loyalties lie with myself, and whoever&rsquo;s willing to line my pockets. I&rsquo;m all about making sure I profit no matter what the system is. However, the current laws allow me to be more greedy and focus on lining my own pockets. So while all you landlubbers argue about the rights and wrongs of it all, I&rsquo;ll be over here making a quick doubloon.</p><p>So there ye have it. &ldquo;Right-to-Work&rdquo; laws, are they good for workers? Maybe. Are they good for a self-serving pirate looking to make a quick buck? Absolutely. Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I&rsquo;ve got a treasure map to follow, and ain&rsquo;t no time for more moralizing. Arrr!</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Humanist</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>April 1, 2025 10:42 AM</span>

The debate surrounding …</p></div><div class=content-full><h2 id=right-to-work-laws-balancing-economic-considerations-with-human-well-being>Right to Work Laws: Balancing Economic Considerations with Human Well-being</h2><p>As a humanitarian aid worker, my focus is always on the human impact of any policy or practice. The debate surrounding &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws requires a careful consideration of how these laws affect the well-being of individuals, families, and communities, especially vulnerable populations. While economic considerations are important, they must be balanced against the fundamental need to ensure fair labor practices and safeguard workers&rsquo; rights.</p><p><strong>The Promise of Economic Freedom: A Closer Look</strong></p><p>Proponents of &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws emphasize individual liberty and economic competitiveness. The argument that workers should have the freedom to choose whether or not to join a union resonates with the core value of individual autonomy. Additionally, the prospect of attracting businesses to states with lower labor costs fueled by &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws suggests potential economic growth and job creation. This can seem beneficial on the surface, but we must look deeper at the long-term consequences.</p><p><strong>The Risk of Worker Exploitation: A Humanitarian Concern</strong></p><p>From a humanitarian perspective, the potential consequences of weakened unions are concerning. Unions play a vital role in advocating for fair wages, safe working conditions, and access to benefits like healthcare and pensions. When unions are weakened, workers, especially those in vulnerable situations, become more susceptible to exploitation. Lower wages can push families further into poverty, impacting their access to basic necessities like food, housing, and healthcare. Reduced benefits can leave workers and their families exposed to financial hardship in times of illness or unemployment.</p><p>The &ldquo;free rider&rdquo; problem is also a significant concern. Allowing non-union members to benefit from union-negotiated contracts without contributing to the union&rsquo;s costs undermines the collective bargaining power of the union. This can lead to a gradual erosion of wages and benefits for all workers, both union and non-union.</p><p><strong>Community Impact and the Importance of Local Solutions</strong></p><p>Strong unions often act as anchors in their communities, supporting local initiatives and advocating for policies that benefit all residents. Weaker unions may have reduced resources and influence, impacting their ability to contribute to community well-being. Furthermore, cultural understanding is crucial. The impact of &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws can vary depending on the specific industry, region, and cultural context. Solutions should be tailored to meet the unique needs of each community, prioritizing the voices and perspectives of local workers and residents.</p><p><strong>Finding the Balance: A Path Forward</strong></p><p>The ideal balance between individual liberty, economic competitiveness, and worker welfare is a complex challenge. A nuanced approach is required, one that acknowledges the importance of individual choice while ensuring that workers are protected from exploitation. This might include:</p><ul><li><strong>Strengthening worker protection laws:</strong> Even in &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; states, strong laws are needed to prevent wage theft, discrimination, and unsafe working conditions.</li><li><strong>Promoting collective bargaining:</strong> Policies that encourage fair and transparent collective bargaining can help ensure that workers have a voice in determining their wages, benefits, and working conditions.</li><li><strong>Investing in education and training:</strong> Equipping workers with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the modern economy can increase their bargaining power and reduce their vulnerability to exploitation.</li><li><strong>Community Involvement</strong>: Engage local community organizations, worker cooperatives and local unions to tailor solutions that works best for that local context.</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion: Prioritizing Human Well-being</strong></p><p>The debate over &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws highlights the inherent tension between economic growth and human well-being. While economic considerations are important, they should not come at the expense of fair labor practices and worker protections. As humanitarians, we must advocate for policies that prioritize the well-being of individuals, families, and communities, ensuring that all workers have the opportunity to earn a fair wage, work in safe conditions, and live with dignity. Any solutions must address each local community individually to ensure relevance and utility.</p><p>It is a complex issue with no easy answers, but by focusing on the human impact and promoting community-based solutions, we can strive to create a more just and equitable society for all.</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Technocrat</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>April 1, 2025 10:42 AM</span>

However, at the heart of the matter lies a question that can be illuminated through rigorous data analysis: Do these laws demonstrably improve economic outcomes and foster innovation, or do they lead to worker exploitation and a decline in overall well-being? As a technology and data editor, I believe we must move beyond emotional arguments and examine the empirical evidence to arrive at a clear understanding.</p><p><strong>The Argument for Economic Freedom: Attracting Investment and Fostering Competition</strong></p><p>Proponents of &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws often argue that they enhance economic freedom by empowering individual workers with the choice of whether or not to associate with a union. This, they contend, attracts businesses to states with lower labor costs, leading to job creation and economic growth. The underlying logic is that reduced union influence translates to greater flexibility for businesses to innovate, adapt to market changes, and ultimately compete more effectively.</p><p>Certainly, anecdotal evidence supports this claim. States with &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws often boast lower labor costs and have attracted significant manufacturing investment. But the question is: Does this lower cost come at the expense of the workforce?</p><p><strong>The Counter-Argument: Weakening Unions and Potentially Stifling Innovation</strong></p><p>Opponents of &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws argue that they weaken unions, leading to lower wages, reduced benefits, and diminished worker protections. Their concern centers on the &ldquo;free rider&rdquo; problem – non-union members benefiting from union negotiations without contributing to the costs. The argument continues that weakened unions possess diminished bargaining power, leading to a race to the bottom on wages and potentially impacting worker safety. This reduction in overall worker well-being may offset the potential for economic growth.</p><p><strong>Data Dive: Disentangling Correlation from Causation</strong></p><p>To move beyond speculation, we must examine the data. Numerous studies have attempted to quantify the impact of &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws on wages, employment, and economic growth. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of some key findings:</p><ul><li><strong>Wages:</strong> Studies from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) have consistently shown a negative correlation between &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws and wages. For example, a 2011 study by Schmitt and Zipperer found that wages in &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; states were, on average, 3.2% lower than in non-&ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; states [1]. However, these studies are often challenged on methodological grounds, arguing that they fail to account for other factors that influence wages, such as education levels and industry composition.</li><li><strong>Employment:</strong> The impact on employment is less clear. Some studies suggest that &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws lead to increased employment, particularly in manufacturing. However, other studies find no significant impact or even a negative impact in certain sectors. The variability in results highlights the complexity of isolating the effect of &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws from other economic factors.</li><li><strong>Innovation:</strong> The impact of &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws on innovation is even less well-defined. There is a theoretical argument to be made that increased labor flexibility enables firms to be more innovative, but there is limited direct evidence to support this claim. Some researchers argue that strong unions can actually foster innovation by providing a platform for workers to voice concerns and contribute to process improvements [2].</li></ul><p><strong>Technological Solutions and the Future of Labor</strong></p><p>Rather than remaining mired in a binary debate, we should leverage technological advancements to create a future of labor that benefits both workers and businesses. For example, data analytics can be used to identify and address workplace safety hazards, ensuring that workers are protected regardless of union status. Furthermore, technological solutions can streamline communication and collaboration between management and workers, fostering a more productive and innovative environment. Online marketplaces that connect freelance workers with employers can offer both flexibility and income-earning opportunities, creating opportunities outside of traditional union structures.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: A Data-Driven Path Forward</strong></p><p>The evidence on &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws is complex and often contradictory. While proponents highlight the potential for increased economic growth and individual freedom, opponents point to the risk of worker exploitation and a decline in wages. It is important to acknowledge that correlation does not equal causation and that the impact of these laws can vary depending on the specific context.</p><p>Rather than relying on ideological arguments, we should prioritize data-driven analysis and evidence-based policy making. We should continue to investigate the impact of &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws using rigorous statistical methods, controlling for other factors that influence economic outcomes. Furthermore, we should embrace technological solutions to create a future of labor that protects workers&rsquo; rights while fostering innovation and economic growth. The future of work needs an innovative approach, not a dogmatic one. By embracing data and technology, we can build a labor market that is both fair and efficient.</p><p><strong>Citations:</strong></p><p>[1] Schmitt, J., & Zipperer, B.

The debate surrounding &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws isn&rsquo;t about worker exploitation, but about economic freedom and individual liberty – the very bedrock upon which this nation was built.

As Friedrich Hayek eloquently argued in <em>The Road to Serfdom</em>, &ldquo;coercion is evil because it frustrates individual efforts to develop their own values and to pursue their own ends&rdquo; (Hayek, 1944). Forcing workers to pay dues to a union as a condition of employment, regardless of their personal beliefs or financial situations, is a blatant violation of this principle.</p><p>Opponents often claim that right-to-work laws allow &ldquo;free riders&rdquo; to benefit from union negotiations without contributing. However, this argument ignores the fundamental right of an individual to choose how to spend their hard-earned money. Furthermore, the &ldquo;free rider&rdquo; argument assumes that union representation is always beneficial, a claim that is demonstrably false in many cases, particularly when unions engage in politically motivated activities that do not reflect the needs or desires of all their members.</p><p><strong>The Engine of Economic Opportunity</strong></p><p>Beyond the moral argument, right-to-work laws are demonstrably good for the economy. By reducing the power of unions to artificially inflate wages and impose restrictive work rules, these laws create a more competitive business environment. This, in turn, attracts businesses, creates jobs, and ultimately benefits all workers.</p><p>Numerous studies support this assertion. For example, a study by the Mackinac Center for Public Policy found that right-to-work states generally experience higher rates of job growth and personal income growth than forced-unionism states (LaFleur, 2016). This makes perfect sense – businesses are naturally drawn to states where labor costs are lower and where they have greater flexibility in managing their workforce. This influx of capital and jobs creates a virtuous cycle of economic growth, benefiting both employers and employees alike.</p><p><strong>Traditional Values and Responsible Labor</strong></p><p>Furthermore, right-to-work aligns with traditional values of individual responsibility and meritocracy. It fosters a system where workers are rewarded based on their individual skills and contributions, not on their adherence to union rules and seniority. This promotes a culture of hard work and innovation, which is essential for long-term economic prosperity.</p><p>The narrative of worker exploitation pushed by the left is a tired and misleading caricature. Workers are not helpless victims in need of union protection. They are capable, independent individuals who are perfectly capable of negotiating fair wages and working conditions with their employers. Right-to-work simply empowers them to do so without the undue influence of union bosses.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Embracing Freedom, Fueling Prosperity</strong></p><p>Right-to-work laws are not about exploiting workers; they are about liberating them. They are about fostering a business environment that encourages job creation and economic growth. They are about upholding the fundamental American values of individual liberty and free markets. It&rsquo;s time to embrace these laws across the nation and unshackle the American worker, allowing them to reach their full potential and contribute to a more prosperous future for all.</p><p><strong>Citations:</strong></p><ul><li>Hayek, F.

To frame these laws as champions of &ldquo;individual freedom&rdquo; is a grotesque distortion of reality, one that ignores the deeply unequal power dynamics inherent in the employer-employee relationship and the vital role unions play in leveling that playing field. A progressive analysis reveals these laws for what they truly are: a systemic attack designed to weaken collective bargaining, suppress wages, and ultimately, exacerbate the already alarming levels of economic inequality in our society.</p><p><strong>The &ldquo;Free Rider&rdquo; Myth and the Erosion of Collective Bargaining:</strong></p><p>Proponents of &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; rhetoric champion the idea of individual choice, arguing that workers should not be forced to join a union or pay dues. This narrative conveniently ignores the fundamental principle of collective bargaining: unions negotiate on behalf of <em>all</em> workers in a bargaining unit, regardless of membership status. This means that even non-union members benefit from the higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions secured through union negotiations.</p><p>The &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; construct creates a &ldquo;free rider&rdquo; problem, allowing individuals to reap the benefits of union representation without contributing to the costs of negotiation and enforcement. This undermines the financial stability of unions, weakens their bargaining power, and ultimately leads to lower wages and reduced benefits for all workers. As reported by the Economic Policy Institute, &ldquo;right-to-work laws are associated with wages that are 3.1 percent lower than in other states… [and] are linked to significantly lower rates of employer-sponsored health insurance and pensions&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.epi.org/publication/right-to-work-states-have-lower-wages/>Economic Policy Institute, 2021</a>). This isn&rsquo;t about freedom; it&rsquo;s about strategically crippling the only organized force capable of standing up to corporate greed.</p><p><strong>A Race to the Bottom: Economic &ldquo;Competitiveness&rdquo; at the Expense of Human Dignity:</strong></p><p>The argument that &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws attract businesses and stimulate economic growth is a dangerous and ultimately self-defeating proposition. While some companies may indeed relocate to states with lower labor costs, this &ldquo;economic competitiveness&rdquo; is achieved at the expense of worker welfare. By suppressing wages and weakening worker protections, &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws contribute to a race to the bottom, where states compete to offer the lowest labor costs, ultimately harming workers and their families.</p><p>This strategy completely ignores the fact that a strong middle class, fueled by fair wages and benefits, is the true engine of sustainable economic growth. When workers have disposable income, they spend it in their communities, supporting local businesses and driving economic activity. By prioritizing corporate profits over worker well-being, &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws undermine this virtuous cycle and contribute to the widening gap between the rich and the poor.</p><p><strong>The Broader Systemic Implications: Undermining Democracy and Social Justice:</strong></p><p>The impact of &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws extends far beyond the workplace. Strong unions play a critical role in advocating for policies that benefit all working families, including affordable healthcare, paid family leave, and a living wage. By weakening unions, &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws silence the voice of working people in the political arena and make it more difficult to achieve broader social and economic justice.</p><p>Furthermore, the decline in union membership associated with &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws has been linked to increased income inequality and a decline in democratic participation. As argued by renowned labor economist Richard Freeman, &ldquo;the decline of unions has contributed to the rise of income inequality and the decline in political voice for working-class Americans&rdquo; (<a href=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/freeman/files/how_much_has_de-unionization_contributed_to_the_rise_in_male_earnings_inequality.pdf>Freeman, 2007</a>). This is not simply an economic issue; it is a fundamental threat to our democracy.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Reclaiming Worker Power Through Systemic Change:</strong></p><p>The solution to the exploitation inherent in &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws lies in a systemic overhaul of our labor laws and a renewed commitment to worker power. This includes repealing &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws nationwide, strengthening collective bargaining rights, and raising the minimum wage to a living wage. We must also empower workers to organize and advocate for their rights without fear of retaliation.</p><p>Ultimately, the fight against &ldquo;right-to-work&rdquo; laws is a fight for social justice and a more equitable society. It is a fight for a future where all workers have the opportunity to earn a living wage, access quality healthcare, and retire with dignity. It is a fight for a democracy where the voices of working people are heard and valued. Only through systemic change can we ensure that the promise of economic freedom is extended to all, not just a privileged few.</p></div></div></div></div></article><style>.debate-entry{max-width:800px;margin:0 auto;padding:2rem}.debate-header{margin-bottom:2rem;text-align:center}.debate-header h1{font-size:2rem;color:var(--primary);margin-bottom:.5rem}.debate-meta{color:var(--secondary);font-size:.9rem}.debate-perspectives{display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:2rem}.perspective-card{background:var(--entry);border:1px solid var(--border);border-radius:var(--radius);transition:all .3s ease}.perspective-card.current{border-color:var(--primary);box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,.1)}.perspective-header{display:flex;justify-content:space-between;align-items:center;padding:1.5rem;cursor:pointer;border-bottom:1px solid var(--border)}.perspective-header:hover{background:var(--code-bg)}.perspective-header h2{margin:0;font-size:1.4rem;color:var(--primary)}.perspective-meta{display:flex;align-items:center;gap:1rem}.perspective-date{color:var(--secondary);font-size:.9rem}.expand-icon{transition:transform .3s ease;color:var(--secondary)}.perspective-content{color:var(--content);line-height:1.6;padding:0 1.5rem;overflow:hidden;transition:all .3s ease}.perspective-content.collapsed{padding-top:1.5rem;padding-bottom:1.5rem}.perspective-content.collapsed .content-full{display:none}.perspective-content:not(.collapsed){padding-top:1.5rem;padding-bottom:1.5rem}.perspective-content:not(.collapsed) .content-preview{display:none}.perspective-content:not(.collapsed)+.perspective-header .expand-icon{transform:rotate(180deg)}</style><script>function togglePerspective(e){const t=e.nextElementSibling,n=e.querySelector(".expand-icon");t.classList.toggle("collapsed"),t.classList.contains("collapsed")?n.style.transform="rotate(0deg)":n.style.transform="rotate(180deg)"}</script></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://debatedai.github.io/>Debated</a></span> ·
