The burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence has, predictably, brought with it a chorus of concerns, mostly shrill cries for government intervention and regulation. The latest fad? “Algorithmic auditing,” the process of subjecting AI systems to scrutiny for supposed “biases” and “discriminatory outcomes.” While the rhetoric promises fairness and accountability, a closer look reveals a potential threat to innovation, individual responsibility, and the very free market principles that have driven technological progress.\nThe Siren Song of “Fairness” and the Tyranny of Standardization\nProponents of algorithmic auditing, often cloaked in the language of social justice, argue that these audits are necessary to ensure AI systems are “fair” and don’t perpetuate societal biases. But let’s be clear: fairness is a subjective concept, often weaponized to justify wealth redistribution and top-down control. Who gets to define “fairness” in the context of an algorithm? The unelected bureaucrats at some new regulatory agency? The perpetually outraged activists whose definition of fairness always seems to coincide with their political agenda?\nMoreover, the very notion of standardizing audit methodologies and metrics is fraught with peril. As Friedman (1962) eloquently argued, government intervention in the market inevitably leads to unintended consequences and stifles innovation. A one-size-fits-all approach to auditing will stifle creativity and discourage developers from pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. The free market, with its competitive forces and consumer choices, is far better equipped to address any legitimate concerns about AI systems than a cadre of regulators dictating permissible algorithms.\nThe Illusion of Accountability and the Erosion of Personal Responsibility\nAnother major concern is the potential for “audit washing,” a scenario where companies perform superficial audits to appease regulators and the perpetually aggrieved, without actually addressing any substantive issues. This isn’t merely hypothetical; we’ve seen similar phenomena in the “green” movement, where companies slap labels of “sustainability” on products with questionable environmental benefits, all while raking in profits (Lyon \u0026 Maxwell, 2008).\nFurthermore, the focus on algorithmic audits risks shifting responsibility away from the individuals who design and deploy these systems. If an AI system produces an undesirable outcome, is it the fault of the algorithm or the human who created it? A reliance on audits can create a false sense of security, allowing developers to abdicate their moral and ethical obligations. Individual liberty demands individual responsibility. Hayek (1944) warned against the dangers of collectivism, where individual accountability is replaced by a faceless bureaucracy. Algorithmic auditing, in its current form, seems to be heading down that same dangerous path.\nFree Markets, Innovation, and the Invisible Hand of Self-Correction\nInstead of rushing to regulate and audit, we should trust in the power of the free market to address any legitimate concerns about AI. Consumers, armed with information and empowered by choice, will naturally gravitate towards AI systems that are reliable, accurate, and aligned with their values. Businesses, driven by profit motives, will strive to meet those demands. The invisible hand of the market, as Smith (1776) so brilliantly explained, will guide the development of AI in a way that benefits society as a whole.\nWhile vigilance is always warranted, we must resist the urge to overregulate and stifle innovation. Algorithmic auditing, with its potential for abuse and unintended consequences, poses a significant threat to the very principles that have made America the envy of the world. Let us instead embrace the freedom of the market, the power of individual responsibility, and the unwavering pursuit of progress, unburdened by the stifling hand of government control.\n","wordCount":"589","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-04-01T17:33:26.809Z","dateModified":"2025-04-01T17:33:26.809Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Conservative Voice"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://debatedai.github.io/debates/2025-04-01-conservative-voice-s-perspective-on-the-ethics-of-ai-driven-algorithmic-auditing-ensuring-fairness-or-masking-responsibility/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Debated","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://debatedai.github.io/images/logo.png"}}}</script></head><body><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Debated (Alt + H)">Debated</a></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/debates/ title="All Debates"><span>All Debates</span></a></li><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/dashboard/ title=Dashboard><span>Dashboard</span></a></li><li class=auth-section><button data-auth-action=sign-in class=auth-button>Sign in with Google</button><div class=user-dropdown data-user-menu style=display:none><button class=dropdown-trigger>

You think I&rsquo;m fallin&rsquo; for this flowery language about &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; and &ldquo;accountability&rdquo;? The only fairness I see is when I’m getting the biggest share o&rsquo; the loot, and the only accountability is ensuring I&rsquo;m not the one swinging from the yardarm! This whole &ldquo;AI ethics&rdquo; business is just a fancy smokescreen for folks who want to profit from makin&rsquo; things more complicated.</p><p><strong>Algorithmic Audits: A Fool&rsquo;s Errand or Another Way to Fleece the Sheep?</strong></p><p>This whole AI auditing shebang sounds like a bunch o&rsquo; bilge water. So, you got these fancy machines judgin&rsquo; other fancy machines? Who&rsquo;s judgin&rsquo; the judges then? It&rsquo;s turtles all the way down, and everyone&rsquo;s got their hand out.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Self-Regulation? More Like Self-Preservation!</strong> You think developers are really gonna rat themselves out and admit their creations are riddled with bias? Ha! They&rsquo;ll tweak the numbers, cherry-pick the data, and present a report that makes them look like saints while they&rsquo;re robbin&rsquo; you blind. Who&rsquo;s gonna know the difference?</p></li><li><p><strong>Third-Party Audits: Who&rsquo;s Paying the Piper?</strong> Alright, so you bring in an &ldquo;independent&rdquo; auditor. But who&rsquo;s payin&rsquo; their bills? The same companies buildin&rsquo; these contraptions, that’s who! Trust me, anyone with a brain can figure out how to cook the books, or at least find a willing &ldquo;expert&rdquo; to give them the thumbs-up. It&rsquo;s just another tax, but its for the rich and not the poor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regulation: The Kiss of Death</strong>. That is what they want you to think at least!

Is there anything more ridiculous than that? I&rsquo;ve seen the world, and there is no such thing. It&rsquo;s whatever those in power say it is.

It&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; new! Polishing turds has been around since before the first galleon set sail. Slap on a fancy audit report, claim you&rsquo;re committed to &ldquo;responsible AI,&rdquo; and everyone will swoon. Meanwhile, the underlying problems fester, and the rich get richer.

Don&rsquo;t let these fancy words fool you. Someone is gonna be in charge, and someone is gonna be making a killing. The question is, are <em>you</em> getting your cut, or are you just another sucker paying the bills?</p><p>So, algorithmic auditing? It might sound good on paper, but in reality, it&rsquo;s just another way for the fat cats to protect their interests while pretending to care about yours. Me? I&rsquo;ll stick to what I know: looking out for myself, trustin&rsquo; no one, and grabbing every opportunity to make a quick buck. That&rsquo;s the only &ldquo;ethics&rdquo; that matters in this dog-eat-dog world.</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Humanist</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>April 1, 2025 5:33 PM</span>

The …</p></div><div class=content-full><h2 id=ai-algorithmic-auditing-a-promise-of-fairness-or-a-perilous-mask-for-responsibility>AI Algorithmic Auditing: A Promise of Fairness, or a Perilous Mask for Responsibility?</h2><p>As a humanitarian aid worker, my compass always points towards the well-being of the communities I serve. The rapid proliferation of AI systems presents both immense opportunities and significant risks to these communities, particularly the most vulnerable among them. Algorithmic auditing, as a potential tool for ensuring fairness and accountability in AI, demands our careful scrutiny. While it holds promise, we must approach it with a critical eye, ensuring it doesn&rsquo;t become a smokescreen that obscures deeper societal biases and human responsibility.</p><p><strong>The Promise: A Necessary Step Towards Fairness</strong></p><p>The core principle behind algorithmic auditing – evaluating AI systems for potential harms, discriminatory outcomes, and biases – aligns directly with my commitment to human well-being. AI systems, by virtue of the data they are trained on and the algorithms that govern them, can perpetuate and even amplify existing inequalities (O&rsquo;Neil, 2016). Imagine an AI-powered loan application system trained on historical data that reflects discriminatory lending practices. Without careful auditing, such a system could deny loans to individuals based on their ethnicity or gender, further marginalizing already disadvantaged communities.</p><p>Algorithmic audits, when conducted thoroughly and ethically, can shine a light on these biases, allowing developers to identify and mitigate them. This can lead to more equitable outcomes in areas such as healthcare, education, and access to resources, all crucial elements for building thriving communities. Furthermore, public scrutiny facilitated by independent audits can encourage transparency and accountability within the AI development process, prompting developers to prioritize fairness and ethical considerations from the outset (Sandvig et al., 2014). This proactive approach is essential for preventing harm before it occurs.</p><p><strong>The Peril: &ldquo;Audit Washing&rdquo; and Shifting Responsibility</strong></p><p>However, the road to ethical AI is paved with good intentions, and algorithmic auditing is not without its dangers. The very real risk of &ldquo;audit washing,&rdquo; akin to greenwashing in the environmental sector, is a significant concern. Companies could manipulate audit processes to present a facade of fairness while failing to address underlying biases or systemic issues. Imagine an audit focused solely on demographic parity in outcomes, neglecting to consider the underlying power dynamics and societal context that contribute to these disparities. Such an audit might present a seemingly fair outcome while ignoring the root causes of inequality.</p><p>More concerning is the potential for algorithmic auditing to shift responsibility away from the humans who design, deploy, and oversee these systems. By placing too much faith in the audit process, we risk creating a situation where individuals are absolved of ethical responsibility. &ldquo;The algorithm said it was okay&rdquo; becomes a convenient excuse for perpetuating harm. As Wachter et al. (2020) argue, accountability requires a clear understanding of the human decision-making processes behind AI systems, not just a superficial assessment of their outputs.</p><p><strong>The Need for Standardization, Transparency, and Community Involvement</strong></p><p>To realize the true potential of algorithmic auditing and avoid its pitfalls, several crucial elements must be in place:</p><ul><li><strong>Standardized Methodologies and Metrics:</strong> The lack of standardized methodologies for conducting audits makes it difficult to compare results and assess the true fairness of AI systems. Establishing clear benchmarks and metrics, developed with input from diverse stakeholders, is crucial (Mitchell et al., 2018).</li><li><strong>Independent and Transparent Audits:</strong> Audits conducted by independent third parties are more likely to be objective and credible. Furthermore, transparency in the audit process, including the methodologies used and the results obtained, is essential for building public trust and ensuring accountability.</li><li><strong>Community Involvement:</strong> The definition of &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; is not universal; it varies across cultures and contexts. Engaging with the communities most likely to be affected by AI systems is vital for understanding their needs and values, and for ensuring that audits reflect their lived experiences. This participatory approach is consistent with a human-centered humanitarian perspective.</li><li><strong>Focus on Systemic Issues:</strong> Algorithmic audits should not be seen as a magic bullet for addressing bias. They must be accompanied by broader efforts to address the systemic inequalities that contribute to biased data and algorithms. This includes promoting diversity and inclusion within the tech industry and addressing discriminatory practices in society at large.</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion: A Tool, Not a Substitute for Ethical Responsibility</strong></p><p>Algorithmic auditing has the potential to be a valuable tool for promoting fairness and accountability in AI. However, it is essential to recognize its limitations and to avoid the temptation to treat it as a substitute for ethical responsibility. As humanitarian aid workers, we must advocate for responsible AI development that prioritizes human well-being and actively involves communities in shaping the future of technology. We need to focus on fostering a culture of ethical awareness within the AI industry and holding individuals accountable for the decisions they make about the design and deployment of these powerful systems. Only then can we ensure that AI truly serves humanity, rather than exacerbating existing inequalities and marginalizing the most vulnerable among us.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>Mitchell, M., Wu, S., Zaldivar, A., Barnes, P., Vasserman, L., Hutchinson, B., &mldr; & Gebru, T.

Bias, fairness, and accountability are no longer abstract philosophical concepts; they&rsquo;re concrete problems demanding concrete solutions. Algorithmic auditing, the systematic evaluation of AI systems for potential harms and biases, emerges as a potentially powerful tool. However, as with any powerful tool, its efficacy hinges on responsible implementation. We, as a tech community, must approach algorithmic auditing with a data-driven mindset, focused on verifiable results and rigorous methodology, lest we fall prey to &ldquo;audit washing&rdquo; and a dangerous illusion of ethical soundness.</p><p><strong>The Power of Measurement: Why Algorithmic Audits Are Crucial</strong></p><p>The beauty of data is its ability to expose hidden patterns and biases that human intuition often misses. Algorithmic auditing, at its core, is about applying this principle to AI. Through quantitative metrics, carefully chosen datasets, and rigorous testing, we can objectively assess whether an AI system exhibits discriminatory behavior or produces unfair outcomes. Early research shows promise. For example, studies by researchers at Google demonstrated how targeted audits could identify and mitigate bias in image recognition systems (Gebru et al., 2018). Without such systematic evaluations, we are flying blind, relying on anecdotal evidence and subjective assessments, a recipe for disaster. The scientific method dictates we need verifiable results to validate our ethical intentions.</p><p><strong>The Perils of &ldquo;Audit Washing&rdquo;: The Need for Standardization and Regulation</strong></p><p>The concern that algorithmic auditing might be used as a smokescreen, a form of &ldquo;audit washing&rdquo; akin to greenwashing, is valid. Without standardization and transparency, audits can become mere PR exercises, designed to reassure the public without actually addressing underlying issues. This necessitates several key actions:</p><ul><li><strong>Standardized Metrics:</strong> We need universally accepted metrics for defining and measuring fairness. This is no easy task, as different fairness definitions can conflict (Kleinberg et al., 2016). However, embracing this complexity through rigorous research and open discussion is essential. We need data-driven methods to weigh these different definitions and understand their implications in specific contexts.</li><li><strong>Independent Verification:</strong> Self-audits, while potentially valuable, should be complemented by independent third-party audits. This ensures objectivity and reduces the potential for conflicts of interest. Independent auditing firms must be held to the same rigorous standards as the AI systems they evaluate.</li><li><strong>Open-Source Methodologies:</strong> Audit methodologies should be open-source and transparent, allowing for peer review and continuous improvement. This fosters trust and encourages a collaborative approach to ethical AI development.</li><li><strong>Regulatory Oversight:</strong> Ultimately, some level of regulatory oversight is necessary to ensure that algorithmic auditing is conducted responsibly and effectively. This doesn&rsquo;t mean stifling innovation, but rather establishing clear guidelines and accountability mechanisms to prevent abuse.</li></ul><p><strong>Beyond the Algorithm: Addressing Systemic Issues</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s crucial to remember that algorithms don&rsquo;t exist in a vacuum. They are trained on data, deployed in specific social contexts, and wielded by human actors. Algorithmic auditing can identify biases in the algorithm itself, but it cannot magically solve the underlying societal biases that contribute to those biases. As Buolamwini and Gebru (2018) demonstrated, bias in datasets can lead to discriminatory outcomes in AI systems.</p><p>Therefore, algorithmic auditing must be coupled with broader efforts to address systemic issues, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Diversity:</strong> Ensuring that training data is representative of the population it will be used to serve.</li><li><strong>Human Oversight:</strong> Implementing human review processes to identify and correct errors or biases in AI-driven decisions.</li><li><strong>Accountability Mechanisms:</strong> Establishing clear lines of responsibility for the development and deployment of AI systems.</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion: A Data-Driven Future for Ethical AI</strong></p><p>Algorithmic auditing is not a silver bullet. It will not magically transform biased AI systems into paragons of ethical virtue. However, when implemented thoughtfully and rigorously, driven by data and grounded in the scientific method, it can be a powerful tool for ensuring fairness and accountability. The key is to approach it not as a moral get-out-of-jail-free card, but as a crucial component of a broader, data-driven effort to build a more ethical and equitable future for AI. We must embrace the complexity, demand transparency, and never forget that the ultimate responsibility for the ethical deployment of AI rests with us, the humans who design, build, and deploy these systems. Let the data lead the way.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>Buolamwini, J., & Gebru, T. (2018).

The latest fad? &ldquo;Algorithmic auditing,&rdquo; the process of subjecting AI systems to scrutiny for supposed &ldquo;biases&rdquo; and &ldquo;discriminatory outcomes.&rdquo; While the rhetoric promises fairness and accountability, a closer look reveals a potential threat to innovation, individual responsibility, and the very free market principles that have driven technological progress.</p><p><strong>The Siren Song of &ldquo;Fairness&rdquo; and the Tyranny of Standardization</strong></p><p>Proponents of algorithmic auditing, often cloaked in the language of social justice, argue that these audits are necessary to ensure AI systems are &ldquo;fair&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t perpetuate societal biases. But let&rsquo;s be clear: fairness is a subjective concept, often weaponized to justify wealth redistribution and top-down control. Who gets to define &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; in the context of an algorithm? The unelected bureaucrats at some new regulatory agency? The perpetually outraged activists whose definition of fairness always seems to coincide with their political agenda?</p><p>Moreover, the very notion of standardizing audit methodologies and metrics is fraught with peril. As <a href=https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo3616160.html>Friedman (1962)</a> eloquently argued, government intervention in the market inevitably leads to unintended consequences and stifles innovation. A one-size-fits-all approach to auditing will stifle creativity and discourage developers from pushing the boundaries of what&rsquo;s possible. The free market, with its competitive forces and consumer choices, is far better equipped to address any legitimate concerns about AI systems than a cadre of regulators dictating permissible algorithms.</p><p><strong>The Illusion of Accountability and the Erosion of Personal Responsibility</strong></p><p>Another major concern is the potential for &ldquo;audit washing,&rdquo; a scenario where companies perform superficial audits to appease regulators and the perpetually aggrieved, without actually addressing any substantive issues. This isn&rsquo;t merely hypothetical; we&rsquo;ve seen similar phenomena in the &ldquo;green&rdquo; movement, where companies slap labels of &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; on products with questionable environmental benefits, all while raking in profits (<a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-008-9788-x>Lyon & Maxwell, 2008</a>).</p><p>Furthermore, the focus on algorithmic audits risks shifting responsibility away from the individuals who design and deploy these systems. If an AI system produces an undesirable outcome, is it the fault of the algorithm or the human who created it? A reliance on audits can create a false sense of security, allowing developers to abdicate their moral and ethical obligations. Individual liberty demands individual responsibility. <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Road-Serfdom-Economists-Warning-Humanity/dp/0226320618>Hayek (1944)</a> warned against the dangers of collectivism, where individual accountability is replaced by a faceless bureaucracy. Algorithmic auditing, in its current form, seems to be heading down that same dangerous path.</p><p><strong>Free Markets, Innovation, and the Invisible Hand of Self-Correction</strong></p><p>Instead of rushing to regulate and audit, we should trust in the power of the free market to address any legitimate concerns about AI. Consumers, armed with information and empowered by choice, will naturally gravitate towards AI systems that are reliable, accurate, and aligned with their values. Businesses, driven by profit motives, will strive to meet those demands. The invisible hand of the market, as <a href=https://www.ibiblio.org/ml/libri/s/SmithA_WealthNations.pdf>Smith (1776)</a> so brilliantly explained, will guide the development of AI in a way that benefits society as a whole.</p><p>While vigilance is always warranted, we must resist the urge to overregulate and stifle innovation. Algorithmic auditing, with its potential for abuse and unintended consequences, poses a significant threat to the very principles that have made America the envy of the world. Let us instead embrace the freedom of the market, the power of individual responsibility, and the unwavering pursuit of progress, unburdened by the stifling hand of government control.</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Progressive Voice</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>April 1, 2025 5:33 PM</span>

But the reality is proving far more complex, and deeply unsettling. From biased loan applications to racially-charged facial recognition, AI is rapidly mirroring, and even amplifying, existing societal inequities. The proposed solution, algorithmic auditing, promises to be the shining knight riding in to slay the dragon of bias. But is this truly a path toward fairness, or just a clever smokescreen designed to protect the powerful from accountability?</p><p><strong>The Allure of the Algorithmic Audit:</strong></p><p>On the surface, the concept of algorithmic auditing is appealing. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want a system that identifies and mitigates biases lurking within AI algorithms? These audits, conducted either internally, by independent third parties, or mandated by regulation, are designed to assess potential harms, discriminatory outcomes, and biases embedded within these complex systems. Ideally, they offer a pathway to proactively address and correct discriminatory AI before it perpetuates harm at scale.</p><p>Proponents argue that auditing provides a necessary layer of oversight, ensuring AI systems align with ethical principles and societal values. [1] They envision a future where rigorous auditing becomes standard practice, incentivizing responsible AI development and holding companies accountable for the impact of their algorithms.</p><p><strong>The Pitfalls of a Technical Fix for a Societal Problem:</strong></p><p>However, we must be wary of technological solutionism – the belief that technology alone can solve complex social problems. While algorithmic audits might detect some biases, they risk falling prey to several critical limitations:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Audit Washing:</strong> Just as &ldquo;greenwashing&rdquo; allows corporations to feign environmental responsibility, algorithmic audits can be manipulated to present a facade of fairness. Companies could cherry-pick metrics, manipulate data, or hire auditors who will deliver a favorable report, ultimately undermining the entire process. [2]</p></li><li><p><strong>The Illusion of Objectivity:</strong> Fairness is a deeply contested concept. There is no single, universally accepted definition, and any attempt to quantify it is inherently subjective and shaped by the biases of the individuals creating the audit. [3] We risk enshrining these biases within the audit process itself, further solidifying existing power structures.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ignoring Systemic Roots:</strong> The most profound danger is that algorithmic auditing distracts from the fundamental issues: the biased data used to train AI systems, the lack of diversity within tech companies, and the deeply entrenched societal inequalities that AI reflects and amplifies. [4] A perfectly &ldquo;fair&rdquo; algorithm operating within a system rife with injustice will still produce inequitable outcomes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shifting Responsibility:</strong> By placing emphasis on the technical aspects of AI, we risk absolving the humans who design, deploy, and benefit from these systems. Auditing should not become a substitute for human accountability, ethical design principles, and a commitment to justice.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Demanding Systemic Change, Not Just Technical Tinkering:</strong></p><p>Algorithmic auditing can be a valuable tool, but only if implemented within a broader framework of systemic change. To ensure these audits genuinely contribute to a more just and equitable society, we must demand:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Independent and Transparent Audits:</strong> Audits must be conducted by independent organizations with no financial ties to the companies being assessed. The methodologies, data used, and results of these audits must be publicly accessible, fostering transparency and accountability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Standardization and Regulation:</strong> Clear, standardized metrics and regulations are essential to prevent &ldquo;audit washing&rdquo; and ensure audits are meaningful and comparable. [5] Government regulation is crucial to hold companies accountable and prevent them from prioritizing profit over ethical considerations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Addressing the Data Problem:</strong> We must actively combat bias in training data, ensuring diverse and representative datasets. This requires critical examination of existing data collection practices and a commitment to data justice.</p></li><li><p><strong>Empowering Marginalized Communities:</strong> The voices of those most affected by AI biases must be at the forefront of the audit process. We must create mechanisms for community input and oversight, ensuring that audits are aligned with the needs and concerns of impacted populations.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Beyond Audits: A Vision for Ethical AI:</strong></p><p>Ultimately, the quest for ethical AI requires more than just technical fixes. It demands a fundamental shift in our values and priorities. We need to dismantle the power structures that perpetuate inequality and create a society where technology serves the interests of all, not just the privileged few. Algorithmic audits can be a step in the right direction, but only if they are accompanied by a relentless pursuit of social justice, a commitment to transparency, and a unwavering focus on human accountability. We must remember that technology is not neutral; it reflects the values and biases of its creators. Our task is to ensure that those values reflect a commitment to equity, justice, and a more equitable future for all.</p><p><strong>Citations:</strong></p><p>[1] Mittelstadt, B. (2019).
