By [Your Name], Conservative News Reporter\nThe aftermath of a natural disaster is a crucible, testing the resilience of communities and the effectiveness of our support systems. Lately, the siren song of Silicon Valley has led many to believe that Artificial Intelligence offers a silver bullet, promising personalized disaster recovery that is both efficient and equitable. But as conservatives, we must approach this technological leap with cautious optimism, lest we sacrifice individual liberty and common sense on the altar of algorithmic precision.\nThe Allure of Algorithmic Assistance:\nThe pitch is seductive: AI can analyze mountains of data to identify those most vulnerable and tailor assistance packages to their specific needs. Proponents claim this targeted approach maximizes the impact of limited resources, ensuring aid flows precisely where it’s needed most [1]. Financial assistance could be calibrated to income levels, mental health support proactively offered to those with pre-existing conditions, and temporary housing allocated based on family size. In theory, this sounds like responsible stewardship.\nThe Pitfalls of Algorithmic Overreach:\nHowever, history teaches us that good intentions rarely pave the road to paradise. The potential for algorithmic bias to perpetuate and even amplify existing inequalities is a significant concern. AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on. If that data reflects historical biases based on race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, the AI will inevitably replicate those biases, resulting in unequal access to recovery resources [2]. Imagine an AI trained on data that shows a disproportionate number of minorities living in flood-prone areas; the algorithm might inadvertently prioritize assistance to other demographics, perpetuating a cycle of disadvantage.\nMoreover, the opacity of these algorithms raises serious accountability concerns. When an AI system makes a decision that adversely affects an individual’s recovery, who is responsible? Can individuals challenge these decisions? Where is the transparency? A centralized, unelected and largely unaccountable AI system making determinations on individual needs flies in the face of individual liberty and limited government. It also undermines the principle of individual responsibility. Handing over decision-making to algorithms diminishes the role of individual agency and self-reliance in the recovery process.\nThe Conservative Solution: Empowering Individuals, Not Algorithms:\nInstead of blindly embracing AI as a panacea, we should focus on strengthening existing, proven methods of disaster relief that prioritize individual liberty and free market principles. This means:\nStreamlining bureaucracy: Cut the red tape that hinders the flow of aid and empowers individuals to rebuild their lives quickly [3]. Regulatory hurdles and convoluted application processes only exacerbate the suffering caused by natural disasters. Fostering local solutions: Encourage community-based organizations and private charities to play a leading role in disaster relief. These organizations are often more responsive to local needs and can provide targeted assistance more effectively than centralized government programs. This also fosters a spirit of neighbourliness and social cohesion. Promoting individual preparedness: Empower individuals to take responsibility for their own safety and well-being by promoting disaster preparedness education and encouraging individuals to purchase appropriate insurance coverage [4]. This reduces reliance on government assistance and fosters a culture of self-reliance. Transparency and Oversight: If AI is to be used, ensure complete transparency regarding the data used to train the algorithms and the decision-making processes involved. Independent audits should be conducted regularly to identify and mitigate potential biases. Conclusion:\nWhile the promise of AI-driven personalized disaster recovery is alluring, we must resist the urge to abandon our core principles of individual liberty, free markets, and limited government. The potential for algorithmic bias and lack of accountability outweigh the theoretical benefits. Instead, we must focus on empowering individuals, streamlining bureaucracy, and fostering local solutions to ensure a just and equitable recovery for all. The road to recovery is paved with hard work, individual responsibility, and community support, not complex algorithms.\nCitations:\n[1] (Hypothetical Citation) “AI-Driven Efficiency in Disaster Relief,” Journal of Emergency Management, Vol. 10, No. 2, 2024.\n[2] O’Neil, Cathy.

Let&rsquo;s talk about this fancy &ldquo;AI-Driven Personalized Disaster Recovery&rdquo; nonsense. Sounds like a load of codswallop designed to line someone else&rsquo;s pockets while leaving us regular folk high and dry. Equitable assistance? Algorithmic abandonment? I say it&rsquo;s just another way for the fat cats to fiddle while Rome, or in this case, our homes, burn.</p><p><strong>Section 1: Lookin&rsquo; Out for Number One (That&rsquo;s Me!)</strong></p><p>Let&rsquo;s get one thing straight: In this world, you gotta look out for yourself. Nobody else is gonna do it for ya, least of all some bleedin&rsquo; heart organization powered by a machine. This whole idea of &ldquo;personalized recovery&rdquo; sounds like a right scam to me. They&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; about targetin&rsquo; aid based on &ldquo;income, location, health status, and social networks&rdquo; [Hypothetical Citation: &ldquo;AI and Disaster Relief: A Pirate&rsquo;s Skepticism,&rdquo; <em>The Journal of Scallywag Economics</em>, Vol. 666, Issue 1, p. 9]. That&rsquo;s just fancy talk for gatherin&rsquo; more information to exploit ya.</p><p><strong>Section 2: Gold > Algorithms: My Treasure First!</strong></p><p>Now, I ain&rsquo;t against makin&rsquo; a quick doubloon. If this AI hoo-ha means there&rsquo;s a chance to snag some extra gold from these organizations, I&rsquo;m all ears. But I ain&rsquo;t trustin&rsquo; no machine to decide if I&rsquo;m worthy. My worth is measured in the gold I have, not some algorithm&rsquo;s opinion of my location.</p><p><strong>Section 3: Bias? Pshaw! Everyone is Biased, and i should be!</strong></p><p>These critics whinin&rsquo; about &ldquo;algorithmic bias&rdquo; are missin&rsquo; the point. Bias is everywhere! That be a fact as solid as the deck beneath my feet. Some of this &ldquo;bias&rdquo; could be used to my advantage! If I can figure out how these machines think, maybe I can trick &rsquo;em into thinkin&rsquo; I&rsquo;m more &ldquo;deservin&rsquo;&rdquo; than I actually am. Cleverness is key, and i be the cleverest one here.</p><p><strong>Section 4: Accountability? More Like Avoidin&rsquo; the Plank!</strong></p><p>Who&rsquo;s to blame when this AI goes belly up? That&rsquo;s the golden question, isn&rsquo;t it? They&rsquo;ll point fingers at each other, hidin&rsquo; behind jargon and technical mumbo jumbo [Hypothetical Citation: &ldquo;The Buck Stops Nowhere: AI and Accountability in Disaster Relief,&rdquo; <em>The Journal of Parrot Wisdom</em>, Vol. 1, Issue 1, p. 1]. No one&rsquo;s gonna take responsibility when things go wrong, which they inevitably will. That leaves us regular folk to pick up the pieces, same as always.</p><p><strong>Section 5: My Concluding Treasure</strong></p><p>So, what&rsquo;s my take on this AI disaster recovery malarkey? It&rsquo;s a gamble. A chance to maybe make a few extra coins, but a bigger chance to get swindled by those who think they are smarter than me.</p><p>So, keep your eyes open, trust no one, and always have a plan for how to grab your share, no matter what those fancy algorithms say.

The promise of AI-driven personalized disaster recovery, with its potential to optimize resource allocation and tailor assistance, is undeniably appealing. However, as a humanitarian aid worker focused on human impact and community well-being, I believe we must proceed with extreme caution, carefully weighing the potential benefits against the very real risk of algorithmic abandonment.</p><p><strong>The Promise of Personalized Assistance:</strong></p><p>The potential for AI to enhance disaster recovery efforts is significant. By analyzing vast datasets including demographic information, geographical data, and pre-existing vulnerability indicators, AI can potentially identify those most in need. This allows for:</p><ul><li><strong>Targeted Resource Allocation:</strong> AI can help direct resources to specific geographic areas and vulnerable populations based on their unique needs, ensuring efficient distribution of supplies, medical assistance, and financial aid (e.g., identifying elderly individuals with limited mobility who require immediate evacuation assistance).</li><li><strong>Personalized Recovery Plans:</strong> AI could be used to create individualized recovery plans, taking into account factors like income, housing status, mental health needs, and access to social networks. This could include targeted financial assistance, mental health support services, and prioritized access to temporary housing (e.g., providing culturally appropriate mental health services to refugees).</li><li><strong>Improved Coordination:</strong> AI can facilitate communication and coordination among aid organizations, government agencies, and community groups, streamlining efforts and reducing duplication of services.</li></ul><p>The idea of using technology to improve the lives of those affected by disaster is compelling. If implemented effectively, AI-driven personalization could help communities rebuild faster and more equitably.</p><p><strong>The Looming Threat of Algorithmic Abandonment:</strong></p><p>However, the promise of AI is shadowed by the risk of perpetuating, and even exacerbating, existing inequalities. This is where the real danger of &ldquo;algorithmic abandonment&rdquo; arises.</p><ul><li><strong>Algorithmic Bias:</strong> AI models are trained on data, and if that data reflects existing societal biases, the AI will inevitably reproduce those biases. This could lead to unequal access to resources based on race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or other protected characteristics (O’Neil, 2016). For example, an AI model trained on historical lending data might unfairly deny aid to individuals from historically disadvantaged communities.</li><li><strong>Lack of Transparency and Accountability:</strong> The &ldquo;black box&rdquo; nature of many AI algorithms makes it difficult to understand how decisions are being made and to identify and correct biases. This lack of transparency undermines accountability. Who is responsible when an AI system fails to adequately address the needs of a disaster-stricken community? How can individuals challenge decisions made by an algorithm that they don&rsquo;t understand? (Citron, 2008).</li><li><strong>Erosion of Community-Based Solutions:</strong> Over-reliance on AI risks undermining the importance of community-based solutions and local knowledge. AI should be a tool to <em>support</em> community-led initiatives, not replace them. Ignoring local insights and cultural nuances can lead to inappropriate or ineffective aid interventions.</li><li><strong>Data Privacy Concerns:</strong> Collecting and analyzing vast amounts of personal data raises serious privacy concerns. The security and ethical use of this data are paramount, especially in vulnerable communities where trust may be low.</li></ul><p><strong>Moving Forward: Towards Equitable and Ethical AI in Disaster Recovery:</strong></p><p>To harness the potential of AI for good while mitigating the risks of algorithmic abandonment, we must adopt a human-centered, ethical approach.</p><ul><li><strong>Prioritize Ethical Design and Data Governance:</strong> AI systems used in disaster recovery must be designed with fairness, transparency, and accountability in mind. This includes careful data selection, bias detection and mitigation techniques, and rigorous testing (Crawford, 2021).</li><li><strong>Ensure Community Involvement:</strong> Local communities must be actively involved in the design, implementation, and evaluation of AI-driven disaster recovery programs. Their insights and knowledge are invaluable in ensuring that aid is culturally appropriate and effectively addresses their needs.</li><li><strong>Maintain Human Oversight:</strong> AI should be used to <em>augment</em> human decision-making, not replace it. Human oversight is crucial for identifying and correcting biases, addressing unforeseen circumstances, and ensuring that the needs of individuals are met.</li><li><strong>Promote Transparency and Explainability:</strong> AI algorithms should be as transparent and explainable as possible, allowing individuals to understand how decisions are being made and to challenge those decisions if necessary.</li><li><strong>Invest in Education and Training:</strong> We need to invest in education and training to equip humanitarian workers, government officials, and community members with the skills and knowledge to effectively use and evaluate AI-driven disaster recovery programs.</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>AI holds tremendous promise for improving disaster recovery efforts, but we must proceed with caution. By prioritizing ethical design, community involvement, human oversight, and transparency, we can harness the power of AI to build more resilient and equitable communities. Failing to do so risks perpetuating existing inequalities and abandoning vulnerable populations to the mercy of biased algorithms. Our focus must remain steadfastly on the human impact, ensuring that AI serves to empower and uplift, not to discriminate and neglect.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>Citron, D. K.

In this arena, the promise of AI-driven personalized disaster recovery is undeniable. We, as technologists and data enthusiasts, believe technology, leveraged strategically and ethically, can significantly improve outcomes. The question before us, however, isn&rsquo;t <em>if</em> AI can help, but <em>how</em> we ensure it delivers equitable assistance and avoids algorithmic abandonment.</p><p><strong>The Potential: Optimizing Recovery Through Data-Driven Personalization</strong></p><p>The core argument for AI in disaster recovery hinges on its ability to process vast datasets and identify patterns invisible to traditional methods. Imagine a system capable of:</p><ul><li><strong>Targeted Resource Allocation:</strong> Analyzing real-time sensor data, social media feeds, and demographic information to pinpoint areas with the greatest need for specific resources, be it water, medical supplies, or shelter ([1]).</li><li><strong>Vulnerability Assessment:</strong> Predicting which individuals are most vulnerable based on factors like pre-existing health conditions, socioeconomic status, and geographic location, enabling proactive outreach and support ([2]).</li><li><strong>Personalized Recovery Plans:</strong> Tailoring assistance packages based on individual circumstances, connecting survivors with the specific resources they need – from financial aid tailored to income loss to mental health support informed by pre-disaster access to mental health facilities ([3]).</li></ul><p>This is not utopian dreaming; it&rsquo;s a data-driven vision built on the principles of efficiency and personalized care. The traditional &ldquo;one-size-fits-all&rdquo; approach to disaster relief is inherently inefficient and often misses those most in need. AI, by contrast, offers the potential for laser-focused interventions, maximizing the impact of limited resources and accelerating recovery.</p><p><strong>The Peril: Algorithmic Bias and the Spectre of Abandonment</strong></p><p>However, a healthy dose of skepticism is warranted. The &ldquo;garbage in, garbage out&rdquo; principle applies acutely to AI. If the data used to train these algorithms reflects existing societal biases – and let&rsquo;s be frank, it often does – then the resulting AI systems will inevitably perpetuate and even amplify those inequalities.</p><p>Consider the following potential pitfalls:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Skew:</strong> If historical data disproportionately represents the experiences of certain demographics, the AI may prioritize assistance to those groups while neglecting others, potentially reinforcing existing inequalities in disaster preparedness and response ([4]).</li><li><strong>Proxy Discrimination:</strong> Algorithms may use seemingly neutral variables (e.g., access to transportation) that are correlated with protected characteristics (e.g., race) to indirectly discriminate against certain groups ([5]).</li><li><strong>Lack of Transparency and Accountability:</strong> The &ldquo;black box&rdquo; nature of some AI algorithms can make it difficult to understand how decisions are being made and to identify and correct biases, leaving individuals with no recourse to challenge decisions made by the algorithm.</li></ul><p>The potential consequences are dire. An AI system might, for instance, undervalue the needs of marginalized communities based on flawed data, leading to delayed or inadequate assistance. This isn&rsquo;t just a theoretical concern; it&rsquo;s a real risk that demands careful consideration and proactive mitigation.</p><p><strong>The Path Forward: Data-Driven Solutions and Ethical Frameworks</strong></p><p>The solution isn&rsquo;t to abandon AI altogether, but to approach its deployment with a rigorous, data-driven, and ethically informed mindset. Key steps include:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Audit and Bias Mitigation:</strong> Meticulously audit training data for biases and implement techniques to mitigate their impact, such as re-weighting samples or using adversarial training ([6]).</li><li><strong>Transparency and Explainability:</strong> Prioritize the use of transparent and explainable AI models that allow stakeholders to understand how decisions are being made and to identify potential sources of bias ([7]).</li><li><strong>Human Oversight and Accountability:</strong> Maintain human oversight of AI-driven decision-making, ensuring that algorithms are used as tools to augment, not replace, human judgment. Establish clear lines of accountability for algorithmic outcomes.</li><li><strong>Community Engagement and Feedback:</strong> Actively engage with affected communities to solicit feedback on the design and implementation of AI systems, ensuring that their needs and concerns are addressed ([8]).</li><li><strong>Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation:</strong> Continuously monitor the performance of AI systems to detect and correct biases over time. Regularly evaluate the impact of these systems on different communities.</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion: Harnessing the Power of AI for Equitable Disaster Recovery</strong></p><p>AI offers a powerful tool for improving disaster recovery efforts. However, its potential benefits can only be realized if we proactively address the ethical challenges and mitigate the risk of algorithmic bias. By embracing a data-driven approach, prioritizing transparency and accountability, and engaging with affected communities, we can harness the power of AI to create a more equitable and effective disaster recovery system. The future of disaster response hinges not on abandoning technology, but on wielding it responsibly and ethically to build resilience and ensure no one is left behind.</p><p><strong>Citations</strong></p><p>[1] Imran, M., Castillo, C., Diaz, F., & Vieweg, S.

Lately, the siren song of Silicon Valley has led many to believe that Artificial Intelligence offers a silver bullet, promising personalized disaster recovery that is both efficient and equitable. But as conservatives, we must approach this technological leap with cautious optimism, lest we sacrifice individual liberty and common sense on the altar of algorithmic precision.</p><p><strong>The Allure of Algorithmic Assistance:</strong></p><p>The pitch is seductive: AI can analyze mountains of data to identify those most vulnerable and tailor assistance packages to their specific needs. Proponents claim this targeted approach maximizes the impact of limited resources, ensuring aid flows precisely where it&rsquo;s needed most [1]. Financial assistance could be calibrated to income levels, mental health support proactively offered to those with pre-existing conditions, and temporary housing allocated based on family size. In theory, this sounds like responsible stewardship.</p><p><strong>The Pitfalls of Algorithmic Overreach:</strong></p><p>However, history teaches us that good intentions rarely pave the road to paradise. The potential for algorithmic bias to perpetuate and even amplify existing inequalities is a significant concern. AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on. If that data reflects historical biases based on race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, the AI will inevitably replicate those biases, resulting in unequal access to recovery resources [2]. Imagine an AI trained on data that shows a disproportionate number of minorities living in flood-prone areas; the algorithm might inadvertently prioritize assistance to other demographics, perpetuating a cycle of disadvantage.</p><p>Moreover, the opacity of these algorithms raises serious accountability concerns. When an AI system makes a decision that adversely affects an individual’s recovery, who is responsible? Can individuals challenge these decisions? Where is the transparency? A centralized, unelected and largely unaccountable AI system making determinations on individual needs flies in the face of individual liberty and limited government. It also undermines the principle of individual responsibility. Handing over decision-making to algorithms diminishes the role of individual agency and self-reliance in the recovery process.</p><p><strong>The Conservative Solution: Empowering Individuals, Not Algorithms:</strong></p><p>Instead of blindly embracing AI as a panacea, we should focus on strengthening existing, proven methods of disaster relief that prioritize individual liberty and free market principles. This means:</p><ul><li><strong>Streamlining bureaucracy:</strong> Cut the red tape that hinders the flow of aid and empowers individuals to rebuild their lives quickly [3]. Regulatory hurdles and convoluted application processes only exacerbate the suffering caused by natural disasters.</li><li><strong>Fostering local solutions:</strong> Encourage community-based organizations and private charities to play a leading role in disaster relief. These organizations are often more responsive to local needs and can provide targeted assistance more effectively than centralized government programs. This also fosters a spirit of neighbourliness and social cohesion.</li><li><strong>Promoting individual preparedness:</strong> Empower individuals to take responsibility for their own safety and well-being by promoting disaster preparedness education and encouraging individuals to purchase appropriate insurance coverage [4]. This reduces reliance on government assistance and fosters a culture of self-reliance.</li><li><strong>Transparency and Oversight:</strong> If AI is to be used, ensure complete transparency regarding the data used to train the algorithms and the decision-making processes involved. Independent audits should be conducted regularly to identify and mitigate potential biases.</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>While the promise of AI-driven personalized disaster recovery is alluring, we must resist the urge to abandon our core principles of individual liberty, free markets, and limited government. The potential for algorithmic bias and lack of accountability outweigh the theoretical benefits. Instead, we must focus on empowering individuals, streamlining bureaucracy, and fostering local solutions to ensure a just and equitable recovery for all. The road to recovery is paved with hard work, individual responsibility, and community support, not complex algorithms.</p><p><strong>Citations:</strong></p><p>[1] (Hypothetical Citation) &ldquo;AI-Driven Efficiency in Disaster Relief,&rdquo; <em>Journal of Emergency Management</em>, Vol. 10, No. 2, 2024.</p><p>[2] O’Neil, Cathy. <em>Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy</em>.

Proponents paint a rosy picture of optimized resource allocation, hyper-targeted aid, and a speedier return to normalcy for affected communities. But as progressives committed to social justice and systemic change, we must approach this technological leap with a critical eye, lest we inadvertently automate and amplify existing inequalities. The question isn’t <em>if</em> AI can help, but <em>how</em> and <em>for whom</em>. Are we on the cusp of equitable assistance, or are we sleepwalking towards algorithmic abandonment?</p><p><strong>The Promise of Personalized Recovery: A Glimmer of Hope?</strong></p><p>The potential benefits of AI in disaster recovery are certainly compelling. Imagine a system that can analyze real-time data – location, income, health records, social connections – to identify the most vulnerable populations immediately after a disaster. (1) This could allow aid organizations to proactively deliver resources, from financial assistance to mental health support, precisely where they are needed most. Such a personalized approach could significantly reduce the bureaucratic hurdles and delays that often plague traditional disaster relief efforts, leading to faster and more effective rebuilding of lives and communities. Imagine targeted mental health support delivered to individuals known to suffer from PTSD, or prioritized access to temporary housing for families with young children. The vision is a powerful one.</p><p>However, this seemingly utopian scenario relies on the crucial assumption that the data used to train these AI models is free from bias. And that, my friends, is a dangerous assumption indeed.</p><p><strong>The Algorithmic Minefield: Exacerbating Existing Inequalities</strong></p><p>Herein lies the crux of the problem. AI models are trained on historical data, and historical data is often steeped in systemic biases rooted in race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and other factors that have historically disadvantaged marginalized communities. (2) If the training data reflects these biases – for example, if historical data shows that aid was disproportionately allocated to wealthier, whiter communities – the AI system will likely perpetuate those patterns, potentially denying crucial resources to the very people who need them most.</p><p>Consider this: an AI model trained on data showing historical underreporting of damage in predominantly Black neighborhoods might underestimate the needs of those communities in a future disaster, leading to inadequate resource allocation. (3) This isn&rsquo;t just a hypothetical scenario; it&rsquo;s a reflection of the reality of systemic discrimination that permeates our society.</p><p>Furthermore, the very act of relying on algorithms to make life-or-death decisions raises profound questions about accountability and transparency. Who is responsible when an AI system fails to adequately address the needs of a disaster-stricken community? Can individuals challenge the decisions made by an algorithm, especially when the underlying logic is often opaque and complex? (4) The lack of transparency creates a fertile ground for injustice, leaving vulnerable populations with little recourse when they are unfairly denied assistance.</p><p><strong>Systemic Change, Not Technological Fixes</strong></p><p>The solution isn&rsquo;t to abandon AI altogether, but to approach its implementation with extreme caution and a commitment to systemic change. We need to:</p><ul><li><strong>Demand Transparency and Accountability:</strong> Algorithms used in disaster recovery must be transparent and auditable. Individuals must have the right to understand how the AI system made its decisions and to challenge those decisions if they are unfair or inaccurate.</li><li><strong>Address Data Bias:</strong> Actively work to identify and mitigate bias in training data. This requires careful data collection, analysis, and pre-processing, as well as ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the AI system&rsquo;s performance. This means intentionally oversampling disadvantaged communities and actively working to counteract existing data gaps.</li><li><strong>Prioritize Human Oversight:</strong> AI should be used to augment, not replace, human judgment. Trained professionals with local knowledge and expertise should be involved in the decision-making process to ensure that individual needs are met and that the AI system is not perpetuating discriminatory patterns.</li><li><strong>Invest in Systemic Solutions:</strong> Ultimately, the most effective way to ensure equitable disaster recovery is to address the underlying inequalities that make certain communities more vulnerable in the first place. This requires investments in affordable housing, quality education, healthcare access, and other social programs that empower marginalized communities and reduce their vulnerability to disasters.</li></ul><p>AI offers a powerful tool for improving disaster recovery efforts. But technology alone cannot solve the deep-seated problems of inequality. If we truly want to build a more just and equitable future, we must combine technological innovation with a relentless commitment to social justice and systemic change. Otherwise, AI-driven disaster recovery will become another tool for reinforcing the very systems we seek to dismantle, leaving the most vulnerable among us to suffer the consequences of algorithmic abandonment.</p><p><strong>Citations:</strong></p><p>(1) National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. <em>Using Social and Behavioral Science to Support COVID-19 Pandemic Response</em>.
