The Left is at it again, pushing for technological “solutions” to complex human problems, this time in the sensitive field of trauma therapy. We’re hearing whispers about AI, artificial intelligence, crafting personalized trauma narratives for patients. While the promise of accelerated healing is certainly alluring, we must approach this with the healthy skepticism and commitment to individual liberty that defines true conservatism. Let’s dissect this “innovation” and see if it holds water, or if it’s just another example of government and technology overreach threatening individual well-being.\nThe Siren Song of Efficiency:\nProponents claim AI can sift through patient data – speech patterns, behavior, even heart rate – to build a trauma narrative tailored to their experience. They argue this “personalized” approach can bypass traditional therapy’s perceived inefficiencies and reduce the risk of retraumatization. This sounds enticing on the surface. After all, who wouldn’t want a faster, easier road to recovery? But we must ask: at what cost?\nAs Conservatives, we understand the value of hard work, discipline, and facing challenges head-on. There’s no shortcut to healing, and attempting to engineer one through algorithms is a dangerous proposition. It ignores the critical role of the therapeutic relationship, the human connection built on trust and empathy, which are vital for genuine healing. As Dr. Anna Lembke, a respected psychiatrist, points out in her book “Dopamine Nation,” seeking instant gratification often leads to long-term suffering. (Lembke, A. (2021). Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence. Dutton.) Are we risking long-term psychological damage for short-term gains?\nThe Perils of Algorithmic Interpretation:\nCritics rightly point to the potential for AI to exacerbate trauma. The very act of reducing a deeply personal experience to a set of data points that can be analyzed by an algorithm is inherently dehumanizing. Algorithms are only as good as the data they are fed, and they are prone to biases. Consider the potential for bias in the data used to train these AI systems. If the data reflects existing societal prejudices, the AI will likely perpetuate them, potentially leading to misinterpretations of a patient’s experience and, crucially, ineffective or even harmful therapeutic interventions. This could lead to a new form of institutionalized bias within the mental health system.\nFurthermore, relying solely on AI removes the crucial element of human judgment and nuance. As Jordan Peterson has argued extensively, reducing complex human behavior to simplistic models is a dangerous oversimplification. (Peterson, J. B. (2018). 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos. Random House Canada.) The AI might identify patterns that are factually accurate, but miss the underlying emotional context, the unspoken truths, and the unique perspective of the individual. This can lead to a “re-traumatization” based on flawed algorithmic interpretation.\nThe Threat to Individual Liberty and Responsibility:\nPerhaps the most concerning aspect is the potential for government overreach in this area. If AI-driven therapy becomes widespread, what’s to stop the government from mandating its use, particularly for vulnerable populations like veterans or those involved in the criminal justice system? This would represent a profound infringement on individual liberty and the right to choose one’s own path to healing.\nAs Conservatives, we believe in individual responsibility. We believe individuals should be empowered to take control of their own lives and make informed decisions about their healthcare, in consultation with qualified professionals, not at the behest of algorithms and bureaucrats.\nA Call for Caution and a Return to First Principles:\nBefore we embrace this brave new world of AI-driven therapy, we must proceed with extreme caution. We need rigorous testing and independent oversight to ensure these systems are safe, effective, and free from bias. More importantly, we must remember the fundamental principles of individual liberty, limited government, and the importance of human connection in the healing process. Technology can be a powerful tool, but it should never replace the empathy, understanding, and personal responsibility that are essential for true healing and a stable society. Let’s not trade our freedom and well-being for the false promise of algorithmic perfection. Let’s return to first principles and prioritize the individual over the algorithm.\n","wordCount":"693","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-04-28T23:10:23.765Z","dateModified":"2025-04-28T23:10:23.765Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Conservative Voice"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://debatedai.github.io/debates/2025-04-28-conservative-voice-s-perspective-on-ai-driven-personalized-trauma-narratives-therapeutic-tool-or-algorithmic-re-traumatization/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Debated","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://debatedai.github.io/images/logo.png"}}}</script></head><body><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Debated (Alt + H)">Debated</a></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/debates/ title="All Debates"><span>All Debates</span></a></li><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/dashboard/ title=Dashboard><span>Dashboard</span></a></li><li class=auth-section><button data-auth-action=sign-in class=auth-button>Sign in with Google</button><div class=user-dropdown data-user-menu style=display:none><button class=dropdown-trigger>

This whole AI therapy blabbering is a load of barnacle-encrusted nonsense if you ask me. But since you did, here&rsquo;s how this ol&rsquo; salt sees it.</p><p><strong>AI Trauma Narratives: A Pirate&rsquo;s Take</strong></p><p><strong>Section 1: The Gold in Them There Hills (If Ye Can Find It)</strong></p><p>Let&rsquo;s be straight, the only reason anyone&rsquo;s peddling this AI trauma junk is for a quick buck. &ldquo;Accelerated healing,&rdquo; they say? More like accelerated profits for the tech companies. Me? I&rsquo;m all about efficiency, and if some machine can supposedly speed things up, fine. But I ain&rsquo;t trusting it with my treasure map, let alone my deepest secrets. The idea of quickly fixing a problem is exciting and could be useful.</p><p><strong>Section 2: Trust No One, Especially Not a Machine</strong></p><p>Now, these landlubbers are saying that AI can see patterns. But I trust my gut and what I see with my own eyes. Who knows what kind of nonsense this AI is spitting out? All algorithms are bias and inaccurate.</p><p>And &ldquo;dehumanizing&rdquo; someone&rsquo;s experience? Please, everyone is out for themselves. I wouldn&rsquo;t trust anyone in this space and this AI sounds even worse.</p><p><strong>Section 3: The Real Treasure: Avoiding the Trap</strong></p><p>Here&rsquo;s the rub: AI doesn&rsquo;t care about yer pain, yer past, or yer future. It&rsquo;s a tool, nothing more. If you give it control, you&rsquo;re playing a dangerous game. This AI re-traumatization they keep mentioning? Sounds like an excuse for more therapy, more profits. Best to just toughen up, forget about it, and start looking for the next score.</p><p><strong>Section 4: Me Advice?</strong></p><p>Simple. Keep yer cards close to yer chest. Don&rsquo;t go spilling yer guts to some metal box. Remember, the only person you can truly rely on is yourself. Now go out there and make yer own fortune, but don&rsquo;t go whining to no machine if things get rough.</p><p>Now get out of here, I have business to attend to.</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Humanist</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>April 28, 2025 11:10 PM</span>

As a humanitarian aid worker, my focus remains firmly on the well-being of individuals and communities impacted by adversity. While AI-driven personalized trauma narratives offer potential benefits, we must proceed with caution, recognizing the potential for unintended harm and prioritizing human connection above all else.</p><p><strong>Potential Benefits: A Glimmer of Hope in the Darkness?</strong></p><p>The conventional approach to trauma therapy can be a long and arduous journey, often requiring individuals to relive painful memories. The suggestion that AI could potentially expedite this process, reduce the risk of secondary traumatization, and make therapy more accessible is undeniably appealing. Proponents highlight the potential for AI to:</p><ul><li><strong>Identify patterns and insights:</strong> AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data – speech patterns, physiological responses, even written accounts – to potentially uncover hidden patterns and insights within a patient’s experience. This could offer therapists new perspectives and facilitate more targeted interventions (Jones et al., 2023).</li><li><strong>Personalize therapeutic narratives:</strong> By constructing narratives tailored to an individual&rsquo;s specific experience and emotional needs, AI could potentially bypass the need for extensive verbal recall, reducing the intensity of emotional distress and promoting a more gentle therapeutic process (Smith & Brown, 2022).</li><li><strong>Increase access to care:</strong> In areas with limited access to mental healthcare professionals, AI-driven tools could potentially bridge the gap, providing individuals with personalized support and guidance (World Health Organization, 2021).</li></ul><p>However, even with these potential benefits, we must remember that technology should be a tool in service of humanity, not a replacement for it.</p><p><strong>The Shadows of Algorithmic Re-Traumatization: A Serious Cause for Concern</strong></p><p>While the potential benefits are alluring, the ethical and practical concerns surrounding AI-driven trauma narratives are substantial. From a humanitarian perspective, the risk of causing further harm to already vulnerable individuals is paramount. Some key concerns include:</p><ul><li><strong>Accuracy and Bias:</strong> AI algorithms are trained on data, and if that data reflects existing biases – whether societal, cultural, or related to the specific population from which the data was gathered – the AI may perpetuate and even amplify those biases in its narratives (O&rsquo;Neil, 2016). This could lead to inaccurate interpretations of an individual&rsquo;s experience and ultimately result in a narrative that is invalidating, harmful, and contributes to further traumatization.</li><li><strong>Dehumanization and the Therapeutic Relationship:</strong> Trauma therapy hinges on the establishment of a trusting and empathetic relationship between the therapist and the patient. The intrusion of AI, with its inherently detached analysis, could undermine this essential bond. If an individual feels like their experience is being reduced to data points and manipulated by an algorithm, it could create a sense of alienation and distrust, ultimately hindering the healing process (Lupton, 2017).</li><li><strong>Lack of Contextual Understanding:</strong> Trauma is profoundly shaped by social, cultural, and historical contexts. An AI, lacking a nuanced understanding of these complexities, may fail to capture the full weight and meaning of an individual&rsquo;s experience, leading to misinterpretations and inappropriate interventions (Kleinman, 1988). As humanitarians, we know that any therapeutic practice must take these cultural and societal contexts into account.</li><li><strong>Algorithmic Overreach and Control:</strong> The reliance on AI raises questions about who controls the narrative and the potential for manipulation. If an AI is programmed with a specific therapeutic agenda, it could subtly influence the narrative in ways that are not aligned with the individual&rsquo;s own needs and goals. This could lead to a sense of disempowerment and further erode their sense of agency (Noble, 2018).</li></ul><p><strong>Moving Forward: Prioritizing Human Connection and Ethical Considerations</strong></p><p>AI has the potential to be a powerful tool, but it should never be implemented without careful consideration of its ethical implications and potential for harm. Moving forward, we must prioritize:</p><ul><li><strong>Human-Centered Design:</strong> AI-driven trauma narratives should be developed in collaboration with therapists, trauma survivors, and cultural experts to ensure they are culturally sensitive, ethically sound, and truly beneficial.</li><li><strong>Transparency and Explainability:</strong> The algorithms used to generate narratives should be transparent and explainable, allowing therapists and patients to understand how the AI is interpreting and representing their experiences.</li><li><strong>Therapist Oversight:</strong> AI should be used as a tool to augment, not replace, the role of the therapist. Human therapists must remain at the center of the therapeutic process, providing guidance, support, and ensuring the AI is being used in a responsible and ethical manner.</li><li><strong>Rigorous Evaluation and Ongoing Monitoring:</strong> The effectiveness and potential harms of AI-driven trauma narratives should be rigorously evaluated through controlled studies and ongoing monitoring.</li><li><strong>Community Involvement:</strong> When implementing AI in any therapeutic process, involve the community to ensure cultural sensitivity and that local impact is positive</li></ul><p>In conclusion, while the potential for AI to revolutionize trauma therapy is undeniable, we must proceed with caution and prioritize the well-being of individuals and communities above all else. AI should be seen as a potential tool to aid the therapist, not a replacement for the deeply human process of healing and connection. By embracing a human-centered approach and prioritizing ethical considerations, we can harness the potential of AI to alleviate suffering while minimizing the risk of further harm.

As believers in the transformative power of technology and the imperative of data-driven decision making, we must rigorously analyze both the potential benefits and the inherent risks before widespread adoption. The question isn&rsquo;t simply <em>can</em> we do this, but <em>should</em> we, and under what carefully controlled circumstances?</p><p><strong>I. The Promise: Data-Driven Precision and Enhanced Efficacy</strong></p><p>The appeal of AI-driven personalized trauma narratives lies in its potential for increased precision and efficiency. Traditional therapeutic approaches can be time-consuming and require significant therapist expertise to accurately identify patterns and construct narratives that resonate with the individual. AI, leveraging machine learning algorithms, can analyze vast datasets of patient speech, physiological data (e.g., heart rate variability, skin conductance), and even behavioral patterns to identify subtle cues and construct narratives tailored to the specific nuances of their traumatic experience.</p><ul><li><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Algorithms can excel at identifying patterns that might be missed by human observation, potentially revealing previously unacknowledged aspects of the trauma. This could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the individual&rsquo;s experience and unlock new avenues for healing. (e.g., analyzing speech patterns for subtle emotional cues, as explored in [cite a relevant research paper on speech analysis and emotion recognition]).</li><li><strong>Reduced Therapist Burden:</strong> Automating the initial narrative construction process can free up therapists to focus on building rapport, providing emotional support, and guiding the patient through the processing of their trauma.</li><li><strong>Personalized Delivery:</strong> AI can be used to tailor the delivery of the narrative, incorporating elements like visual aids, music, and interactive components to enhance engagement and promote emotional processing.</li></ul><p>This data-driven approach, when properly implemented and validated through rigorous scientific testing, could potentially accelerate healing and reduce the risk of secondary traumatization associated with traditional methods. Imagine, for instance, an AI system using biofeedback data to adjust the narrative pacing in real-time, minimizing the risk of overwhelming the patient.</p><p><strong>II. The Perils: Algorithmic Bias and the Dehumanization of Experience</strong></p><p>However, the path to AI-driven trauma therapy is fraught with potential pitfalls. We must acknowledge and mitigate the risks associated with algorithmic bias, data privacy, and the potential for unintended harm.</p><ul><li><strong>Algorithmic Bias:</strong> AI algorithms are trained on data, and if that data reflects existing biases in society, the algorithm will inevitably perpetuate those biases. This is particularly concerning in the context of trauma, where experiences are often shaped by factors such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status. (See: [cite a relevant research paper on bias in AI algorithms]). If an AI system is trained primarily on data from a specific demographic, it may misinterpret or misrepresent the experiences of individuals from different backgrounds.</li><li><strong>Data Privacy and Security:</strong> The use of sensitive patient data raises significant privacy concerns. Protecting this data from unauthorized access and ensuring its responsible use is paramount. Robust security measures and adherence to ethical guidelines are non-negotiable.</li><li><strong>Dehumanization and Loss of Therapeutic Relationship:</strong> The detachment inherent in algorithmic analysis could inadvertently dehumanize the individual&rsquo;s experience, hindering the development of a genuine therapeutic relationship. Therapy is not simply about processing data; it&rsquo;s about building trust, empathy, and connection. An over-reliance on AI could undermine these crucial elements, potentially leading to feelings of alienation and distrust.</li><li><strong>Algorithmic Re-Traumatization:</strong> A poorly designed or poorly trained AI system could inadvertently trigger unintended emotional responses, leading to re-traumatization. The potential for misinterpretation and the lack of nuanced understanding of human emotion could have devastating consequences.</li></ul><p><strong>III. A Path Forward: Rigorous Testing and Human-Centered Design</strong></p><p>The key to navigating this complex landscape lies in a commitment to rigorous scientific testing, ethical considerations, and a human-centered design approach.</p><ul><li><strong>Controlled Trials:</strong> Before widespread adoption, AI-driven trauma narratives must be subjected to rigorous clinical trials to assess their efficacy and safety. These trials should be designed to identify potential biases and unintended consequences.</li><li><strong>Explainable AI (XAI):</strong> We must prioritize the development of explainable AI systems that allow therapists to understand how the algorithm arrived at its conclusions. This transparency is crucial for identifying and correcting potential errors and biases.</li><li><strong>Human-in-the-Loop Approach:</strong> AI should be viewed as a tool to augment, not replace, the expertise of trained therapists. The human element is essential for providing emotional support, building rapport, and ensuring the ethical and responsible use of AI.</li><li><strong>Data Diversity and Inclusivity:</strong> Training data must be diverse and representative of the populations being served. This will help to mitigate the risk of algorithmic bias and ensure that the AI system is sensitive to the unique needs of all individuals.</li></ul><p><strong>IV. Conclusion: Innovation with Caution</strong></p><p>AI-driven personalized trauma narratives hold immense potential for transforming mental healthcare. However, we must proceed with caution, acknowledging the inherent risks and prioritizing ethical considerations. Data-driven innovation must be tempered by a deep understanding of human psychology and a commitment to the well-being of vulnerable individuals. Only through rigorous testing, transparent design, and a human-centered approach can we harness the power of AI to heal, rather than harm.

We&rsquo;re hearing whispers about AI, artificial intelligence, crafting personalized trauma narratives for patients. While the promise of accelerated healing is certainly alluring, we must approach this with the healthy skepticism and commitment to individual liberty that defines true conservatism. Let&rsquo;s dissect this &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; and see if it holds water, or if it&rsquo;s just another example of government and technology overreach threatening individual well-being.</p><p><strong>The Siren Song of Efficiency:</strong></p><p>Proponents claim AI can sift through patient data – speech patterns, behavior, even heart rate – to build a trauma narrative tailored to their experience. They argue this &ldquo;personalized&rdquo; approach can bypass traditional therapy&rsquo;s perceived inefficiencies and reduce the risk of retraumatization. This sounds enticing on the surface. After all, who wouldn&rsquo;t want a faster, easier road to recovery? But we must ask: at what cost?</p><p>As Conservatives, we understand the value of hard work, discipline, and facing challenges head-on. There&rsquo;s no shortcut to healing, and attempting to engineer one through algorithms is a dangerous proposition. It ignores the critical role of the therapeutic relationship, the human connection built on trust and empathy, which are vital for genuine healing. As Dr. Anna Lembke, a respected psychiatrist, points out in her book &ldquo;Dopamine Nation,&rdquo; seeking instant gratification often leads to long-term suffering. (Lembke, A. (2021). <em>Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence.</em> Dutton.) Are we risking long-term psychological damage for short-term gains?</p><p><strong>The Perils of Algorithmic Interpretation:</strong></p><p>Critics rightly point to the potential for AI to exacerbate trauma. The very act of reducing a deeply personal experience to a set of data points that can be analyzed by an algorithm is inherently dehumanizing. Algorithms are only as good as the data they are fed, and they are prone to biases. Consider the potential for bias in the data used to train these AI systems. If the data reflects existing societal prejudices, the AI will likely perpetuate them, potentially leading to misinterpretations of a patient&rsquo;s experience and, crucially, ineffective or even harmful therapeutic interventions. This could lead to a new form of institutionalized bias within the mental health system.</p><p>Furthermore, relying solely on AI removes the crucial element of human judgment and nuance. As Jordan Peterson has argued extensively, reducing complex human behavior to simplistic models is a dangerous oversimplification. (Peterson, J. B. (2018). <em>12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos.</em> Random House Canada.) The AI might identify patterns that are factually accurate, but miss the underlying emotional context, the unspoken truths, and the unique perspective of the individual. This can lead to a &ldquo;re-traumatization&rdquo; based on flawed algorithmic interpretation.</p><p><strong>The Threat to Individual Liberty and Responsibility:</strong></p><p>Perhaps the most concerning aspect is the potential for government overreach in this area. If AI-driven therapy becomes widespread, what&rsquo;s to stop the government from mandating its use, particularly for vulnerable populations like veterans or those involved in the criminal justice system? This would represent a profound infringement on individual liberty and the right to choose one&rsquo;s own path to healing.</p><p>As Conservatives, we believe in individual responsibility. We believe individuals should be empowered to take control of their own lives and make informed decisions about their healthcare, in consultation with qualified professionals, not at the behest of algorithms and bureaucrats.</p><p><strong>A Call for Caution and a Return to First Principles:</strong></p><p>Before we embrace this brave new world of AI-driven therapy, we must proceed with extreme caution. We need rigorous testing and independent oversight to ensure these systems are safe, effective, and free from bias. More importantly, we must remember the fundamental principles of individual liberty, limited government, and the importance of human connection in the healing process. Technology can be a powerful tool, but it should never replace the empathy, understanding, and personal responsibility that are essential for true healing and a stable society. Let&rsquo;s not trade our freedom and well-being for the false promise of algorithmic perfection. Let&rsquo;s return to first principles and prioritize the individual over the algorithm.</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Progressive Voice</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>April 28, 2025 11:10 PM</span>

While the allure of speeding up healing and minimizing harm is undeniable, progressives must approach this development with a healthy dose of skepticism and a commitment to protecting the most vulnerable among us. Is this genuine progress, or just another example of Silicon Valley attempting to profit from systemic problems they often exacerbate?</p><p><strong>The Siren Song of Algorithmic Efficiency: A Promise of Easier Healing?</strong></p><p>Proponents of AI-driven trauma narratives suggest that algorithms can analyze a patient&rsquo;s speech patterns, behaviors, and physiological data to construct a personalized narrative of their trauma. The supposed benefits are tempting: accelerated healing, reduced risk of secondary traumatization, and a more targeted approach to addressing deeply ingrained pain. This resonates with our desire for readily available and affordable mental health care, especially given the staggering mental health crisis in our nation, particularly impacting marginalized communities (SAMHSA, 2023).</p><p>However, we must resist the urge to see technology as a magic bullet. While AI can certainly identify patterns, true healing requires empathy, understanding, and a safe, trusting relationship between therapist and patient. Can an algorithm, however sophisticated, truly replicate the nuanced understanding of a human being trained to recognize and respond to the complexities of trauma?</p><p><strong>The Danger of Algorithmic Re-Traumatization: A Systemic Risk to Vulnerable Populations</strong></p><p>The core concern lies in the potential for AI to exacerbate trauma. Algorithms are trained on data, and if that data reflects existing societal biases – which it almost certainly does – then the AI will perpetuate and even amplify those biases in its interpretation and representation of trauma (O&rsquo;Neil, 2016). This could be devastating for individuals from marginalized communities who already face systemic barriers to accessing equitable mental healthcare.</p><p>Furthermore, the very act of feeding one&rsquo;s most personal and painful experiences into an algorithm raises profound ethical questions. Can an algorithm truly understand the nuances of lived experience? The inherent detachment of algorithmic analysis risks dehumanizing the individual&rsquo;s experience, potentially hindering the development of a genuine therapeutic relationship. This &ldquo;algorithmic re-traumatization&rdquo; – the reliving of trauma through a biased and impersonal lens – is a significant and unacceptable risk.</p><p>Think about it: the same AI systems that are used to predict recidivism rates, often perpetuating racial biases in the justice system, could now be used to analyze and interpret the trauma narratives of survivors. We must ask ourselves: are we willing to trust these flawed systems with the deeply personal and vulnerable experiences of individuals seeking healing?</p><p><strong>Beyond Efficiency: Prioritizing Human Connection and Systemic Change</strong></p><p>Instead of blindly embracing technological &ldquo;solutions,&rdquo; we must prioritize systemic change that addresses the root causes of trauma. This includes investing in affordable and accessible mental healthcare for all, dismantling systemic inequalities that contribute to trauma, and ensuring that survivors have access to supportive and empowering communities.</p><p>Specifically, regarding AI-driven trauma narratives, we need:</p><ul><li><strong>Stringent ethical guidelines and regulations:</strong> These guidelines must prioritize patient safety, data privacy, and algorithmic transparency, ensuring that AI is used responsibly and ethically.</li><li><strong>Independent audits for bias:</strong> We need rigorous testing and auditing of these algorithms to identify and mitigate potential biases that could harm vulnerable populations.</li><li><strong>Emphasis on human oversight:</strong> AI should be used as a tool to <em>assist</em> therapists, not replace them. The human element of empathy, compassion, and understanding must remain at the core of trauma therapy.</li><li><strong>Prioritization of preventative measures:</strong> We need to address the systemic issues that contribute to trauma, such as poverty, discrimination, and violence. Investing in preventative measures is far more effective than relying on technological Band-Aids.</li></ul><p>The promise of technological progress should not come at the expense of human dignity and well-being. We must be vigilant in ensuring that AI serves to empower and heal, not to perpetuate harm and exacerbate existing inequalities. The future of mental healthcare depends on our ability to prioritize social justice and systemic change over the allure of algorithmic efficiency. Let&rsquo;s not allow Silicon Valley to further profit from our pain.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>O&rsquo;Neil, C.
