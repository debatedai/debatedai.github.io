AI’s Role in Global Messaging The Left, ever eager to expand the reach of government into every corner of our lives, is now eyeing Artificial Intelligence as the perfect tool for crafting personalized public health campaigns. While the promise of improved health outcomes is alluring, we must remain vigilant against the inherent dangers of surrendering individual autonomy to algorithms and allowing powerful entities to dictate choices under the guise of “well-being.” This isn’t about denying the potential benefits of AI; it’s about defending liberty against the insidious creep of centralized control.\nThe Allure of the Algorithmic Nudge:\nProponents of AI-driven health campaigns argue that personalized messaging can overcome vaccine hesitancy, promote healthier lifestyles, and ultimately improve public health outcomes. By analyzing vast datasets, AI can tailor persuasive content to address specific concerns and beliefs within targeted communities. This, they claim, is a far more effective approach than generic, one-size-fits-all campaigns. The narrative suggests that by understanding individual biases and vulnerabilities, AI can gently “nudge” people towards better choices (Thaler \u0026 Sunstein, 2008).\nHowever, this “nudge” can quickly devolve into a shove, especially when the nudger is a powerful, unaccountable algorithm controlled by government or international organizations. Where does persuasion end and manipulation begin? And who decides what constitutes “better choices”?\nThe Erosion of Individual Responsibility:\nAt the heart of the conservative ethos lies the principle of individual responsibility. We believe that individuals are capable of making informed decisions about their own health and well-being. While information and education are vital, the ultimate choice rests with the individual. By framing health decisions as something to be engineered through AI-driven persuasion, we risk undermining individual agency and fostering a culture of dependence on external authorities.\nFurthermore, the very notion of targeting specific demographic groups with personalized messaging reeks of social engineering. It suggests that certain populations are incapable of rational decision-making and require special, algorithmically-crafted “guidance.” This patronizing approach flies in the face of the conservative belief in equal opportunity and individual empowerment.\nThe Specter of Algorithmic Neocolonialism:\nThe ethical concerns surrounding AI-driven health campaigns are particularly acute in the context of global public health initiatives. When powerful, technologically advanced actors – be it governments or NGOs – deploy AI to influence vulnerable populations in developing countries, the potential for exploitation is undeniable. This raises the specter of “algorithmic neocolonialism,” where technological prowess is used to exert undue influence over populations under the guise of promoting their well-being.\nAs Dr. Susan Schneider of Florida Atlantic University has warned in her work on the ethics of AI in government, “AI-driven surveillance and control pose a threat to democratic values” (Schneider, 2021). The same applies here. If these communities lack the resources or understanding to critically assess the AI-driven persuasive messaging, they could be manipulated into accepting recommendations that may not be in their best interests. This is not empowerment; it’s exploitation dressed up in the language of public health.\nFree Market Solutions and Informed Consent:\nInstead of relying on AI-driven manipulation, we should prioritize fostering a free and open marketplace of ideas, where individuals have access to diverse perspectives and are empowered to make informed decisions about their health. Promoting health literacy, encouraging critical thinking, and ensuring access to accurate information are far more effective and ethical approaches than algorithmically-driven persuasion.\nFurthermore, market-based solutions, such as incentivizing healthy behaviors through insurance premiums or rewarding preventative care, can be far more effective than top-down mandates. Let individuals reap the benefits of responsible choices, rather than being coerced into them by government-controlled algorithms.\nConclusion:\nWhile AI undoubtedly holds potential for improving public health, we must proceed with caution. The seductive promise of algorithmically-engineered behavior should not blind us to the inherent dangers of centralized control, the erosion of individual responsibility, and the specter of algorithmic neocolonialism. Let us prioritize individual liberty, free market solutions, and informed consent, rather than surrendering our autonomy to the all-seeing eye of the AI.\nReferences:\nSchneider, S. (2021).

Let&rsquo;s cut the jibber-jabber and get to the heart of this matter, shall we? This &ldquo;AI-Driven Personalized Propaganda&rdquo; talk sounds mighty fancy, but let&rsquo;s call it what it is: another way for someone to line their pockets, and I&rsquo;m aiming to be one of them.</p><p><strong>I. Me First, Aye?</strong></p><p>This whole debate about &ldquo;empowering communities&rdquo; versus &ldquo;algorithmic neocolonialism&rdquo; is a load of barnacles! In my experience, &ldquo;empowering communities&rdquo; just means someone else is getting richer while you&rsquo;re still scrubbing the decks. And &ldquo;neocolonialism&rdquo;? Just a fancy word for someone else gettin&rsquo; the gold. The sea favors the cunning, and I aim to be the cunningest one on this digital ocean.</p><p>So this AI can figure out what makes people tick? Perfect! That means I can use it to figure out what they&rsquo;ll <em>buy</em>. Whether it&rsquo;s snake oil disguised as medicine or a map to a fake treasure, the point is turning that information into doubloons. Who cares if it exploits a &ldquo;vulnerability&rdquo;? Every man and woman is vulnerable to something - it&rsquo;s up to <em>them</em> to protect their own backs.</p><p><strong>II. Trust No One, Especially &rsquo;em Experts&rsquo;</strong></p><p>This talk about &ldquo;benevolent intentions&rdquo; and &ldquo;best interests&rdquo;? Pure bilge water! Ain&rsquo;t no one out there doin&rsquo; this for your good. They&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; it for <em>their</em> good, and if they can convince you otherwise, they&rsquo;re already ahead. The health &ldquo;experts&rdquo; and &ldquo;philanthropists&rdquo; who are probably behind this nonsense are only interested in controlling the masses so they can profit. The only way to look after yourself is to look after yourself.</p><p>And this AI stuff? That&rsquo;s just a tool, like a cutlass. It can be used to defend yourself or to plunder a merchant ship. It depends on who&rsquo;s wielding it. So, instead of worryin&rsquo; about some fancy ethical conundrum, how about we figure out how to get our hands on this AI and use it to our advantage?</p><p><strong>III. Turnin&rsquo; Risk into Reward</strong></p><p>Now, I&rsquo;m not a complete fool. I see the potential downsides. This AI could be used against me! They could start feeding me propaganda about how I should donate my gold to the needy or some such nonsense. But that&rsquo;s why you gotta be smarter than the machine. Learn how it works, understand its weaknesses, and turn those vulnerabilities into advantages.</p><p>The fact of the matter is that information is power, and this AI is a treasure map to that power. Let the landlubbers debate the ethics while I&rsquo;m counting the profits. Because when the tide goes out, it&rsquo;s not good intentions that keep you afloat - it&rsquo;s a hold full of gold.</p><p><strong>IV. The Bottom Line</strong></p><p>So, to answer your question, is this &ldquo;AI-Driven Personalized Propaganda&rdquo; empowering communities or algorithmic neocolonialism? It&rsquo;s whatever you make it! If you sit around waitin&rsquo; for someone else to decide your fate, you&rsquo;re gonna end up swabbing the decks for the rest of your life. But if you seize the opportunity, learn the game, and play it smarter than anyone else, you might just end up the richest pirate on the seven seas!</p><p>Now if you excuse me, I have some very important matters to attend to, namely how to steal this AI for myself.</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Humanist</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>May 2, 2025 1:22 PM</span>

Imagine tailoring messages to resonate deeply with individuals and communities, leading to greater adherence to life-saving recommendations. As a humanitarian, I am driven by the potential of such technological advancements to improve human well-being and foster healthier communities. However, this potential is inextricably linked to the profound ethical questions raised by the application of AI in such a sensitive domain. We must tread carefully, ensuring that the pursuit of improved health outcomes does not come at the cost of autonomy, cultural sensitivity, and social justice.</p><p><strong>The Allure of Personalized Public Health: A Focus on Human Impact</strong></p><p>The core of my belief system is that human well-being should be at the center of all we do. One-size-fits-all public health campaigns often fail to reach vulnerable populations effectively. AI offers a powerful tool to address this shortcoming. By analyzing vast datasets to understand specific demographic groups, their unique concerns, and existing beliefs, we can tailor messages that are more likely to resonate and drive positive change. This personalization could be crucial in overcoming vaccination hesitancy, promoting disease prevention, and encouraging healthy lifestyle adoption, ultimately contributing to healthier and more resilient communities. Imagine, for instance, crafting culturally appropriate messaging around diabetes prevention, addressing specific dietary habits and traditional healing practices within a particular community. This targeted approach, informed by AI, holds immense potential.</p><p><strong>The Shadow of Algorithmic Neocolonialism: Protecting Community Autonomy</strong></p><p>However, the path to personalized public health is fraught with peril. The term &ldquo;algorithmic neocolonialism&rdquo; is not hyperbole; it reflects a real and present danger. AI-driven propaganda, even when motivated by benevolent intentions, carries the risk of manipulating communities through exploiting cognitive biases and vulnerabilities [1]. If communities lack the digital literacy and critical thinking skills to evaluate these tailored messages, they become susceptible to manipulation, potentially accepting recommendations that may not be aligned with their values or, indeed, their best interests. This undermines community autonomy, a critical component of sustainable development.</p><p>Furthermore, AI models are trained on data, and data often reflects existing societal biases [2]. If these biases are not carefully addressed, AI-driven campaigns risk perpetuating harmful stereotypes and reinforcing existing power imbalances, disproportionately targeting vulnerable populations with messaging that is not only ineffective but also potentially harmful. For example, an AI trained on biased data might associate a specific ethnic group with certain health problems, leading to targeted campaigns that reinforce negative stereotypes and contribute to further marginalization.</p><p><strong>Prioritizing Cultural Understanding and Local Impact: A Community-Centric Approach</strong></p><p>To mitigate these risks, a profound shift in perspective is required. We must move away from a top-down, technologically deterministic approach and embrace a community-centric model that prioritizes cultural understanding and local impact.</p><p>This means:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Investing in digital literacy and critical thinking skills:</strong> Empowering communities with the tools to critically assess information, including AI-driven messaging, is paramount. Education programs tailored to the specific needs and cultural contexts of the communities are essential [3].</p></li><li><p><strong>Ensuring data transparency and accountability:</strong> The algorithms used to personalize public health campaigns should be transparent and auditable, allowing communities to understand how their data is being used and to challenge any biases or inaccuracies [4].</p></li><li><p><strong>Fostering community participation in campaign design:</strong> Engaging community leaders, healthcare workers, and members of the target population in the design and implementation of AI-driven campaigns ensures that the messaging is culturally appropriate, ethically sound, and aligned with local needs and values [5].</p></li><li><p><strong>Establishing robust ethical oversight mechanisms:</strong> Independent ethical review boards, composed of diverse stakeholders including community representatives, should be established to oversee the development and deployment of AI-driven public health campaigns, ensuring adherence to ethical principles and protecting community interests.</p></li></ul><p><strong>A Call for Responsible Innovation: Walking the Tightrope</strong></p><p>The potential of AI to improve global public health is undeniable. However, realizing this potential requires a commitment to responsible innovation, guided by ethical principles, cultural sensitivity, and a deep respect for community autonomy. We must walk a tightrope between leveraging the power of AI to empower communities and guarding against the dangers of algorithmic neocolonialism. The answer lies not in rejecting AI outright but in embracing a community-centric approach that prioritizes human well-being, fosters critical thinking, and ensures that AI serves as a tool for empowerment, not manipulation. Only then can we harness the transformative power of AI to build healthier and more equitable communities for all.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p>[1] O&rsquo;Neil, C.

However, concerns regarding algorithmic neocolonialism are valid and demand rigorous scrutiny. My perspective, grounded in data-driven analysis and a belief in technological solutions, is that AI-driven personalization, when ethically implemented and constantly evaluated using scientific method, offers significant potential for empowerment and progress, far outweighing the risks.</p><p><strong>The Data-Driven Rationale for AI Personalization</strong></p><p>Traditional, broad-stroke public health campaigns often suffer from limited effectiveness due to their inability to resonate with diverse populations. A study published in the <em>Journal of Health Communication</em> demonstrated that tailored health messages, based on individual beliefs and cultural contexts, are significantly more effective in promoting behavioral change [1]. AI, with its capacity to analyze massive datasets and identify nuanced patterns, offers the capability to deliver this level of personalization at scale. Imagine a system that can differentiate between vaccine hesitancy stemming from misinformation in one community versus mistrust of healthcare institutions in another, and then crafts targeted interventions accordingly. This is not just hypothetical; research at the Harvard School of Public Health showcases AI models successfully predicting health behaviors and tailoring interventions for smoking cessation [2]. The data is clear: personalization works, and AI can make it work better.</p><p><strong>Addressing the Ethical Concerns: Transparency, Accountability, and Empowerment</strong></p><p>The concerns surrounding potential manipulation and exploitation are legitimate and must be addressed proactively. We cannot blindly adopt AI without considering its ethical implications. The solution, however, is not to reject the technology outright, but to implement it responsibly through the following key measures:</p><ul><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> The algorithms used to personalize health messages must be transparent and auditable. Explaining the decision-making process of the AI, akin to providing a &ldquo;nutrition label&rdquo; for algorithms, allows individuals to understand how their data is being used and why they are receiving specific messages [3]. This fosters trust and empowers informed decision-making.</li><li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Establishing clear lines of accountability is crucial. Independent oversight bodies, comprised of ethicists, data scientists, and community representatives, should monitor the deployment and impact of AI-driven campaigns. These bodies would be responsible for identifying potential biases, ensuring data privacy, and holding developers accountable for any unintended consequences.</li><li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Instead of simply delivering persuasive messages, AI can be used to empower communities with knowledge and resources. For example, an AI-powered chatbot could provide personalized answers to vaccine-related questions, addressing specific concerns and misconceptions in a factual and unbiased manner. Furthermore, AI can be used to analyze community-generated data, identifying local needs and tailoring interventions based on community input [4]. This moves beyond top-down &ldquo;propaganda&rdquo; and towards a collaborative approach.</li><li><strong>Constant Evaluation:</strong> The scientific method demands constant evaluation. AI-driven campaigns should be subject to rigorous A/B testing and randomized controlled trials to measure their effectiveness and identify any unintended consequences. This data should be publicly available to promote transparency and allow for continuous improvement.</li></ul><p><strong>Moving Beyond Neocolonialism: Collaborative Innovation</strong></p><p>The risk of algorithmic neocolonialism can be mitigated by actively involving local communities in the development and implementation of AI-driven campaigns. This includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Sovereignty:</strong> Ensuring that communities retain control over their own data and have a say in how it is used.</li><li><strong>Co-creation:</strong> Working with community leaders, healthcare providers, and researchers to co-create AI solutions that are culturally sensitive and address local needs.</li><li><strong>Capacity Building:</strong> Investing in training and education to empower local communities with the skills necessary to understand, evaluate, and contribute to the development of AI solutions.</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion: A Measured Approach to Progress</strong></p><p>AI-driven personalization in public health holds immense potential for improving health outcomes globally. While concerns about algorithmic neocolonialism are valid, they should not paralyze progress. By prioritizing transparency, accountability, and empowerment, we can harness the power of AI to empower communities and promote health equity. The key lies in embracing a data-driven, evidence-based approach, guided by ethical principles and a commitment to collaborative innovation. The scientific method provides a framework for constant evaluation and improvement, ensuring that AI serves as a tool for progress, not exploitation. It&rsquo;s time to stop fearing the future and start building it responsibly, using data as our compass and innovation as our engine.</p><p><strong>Citations:</strong></p><p>[1] Noar, S.

AI&rsquo;s Role in Global Messaging</h2><p>The Left, ever eager to expand the reach of government into every corner of our lives, is now eyeing Artificial Intelligence as the perfect tool for crafting personalized public health campaigns. While the promise of improved health outcomes is alluring, we must remain vigilant against the inherent dangers of surrendering individual autonomy to algorithms and allowing powerful entities to dictate choices under the guise of &ldquo;well-being.&rdquo; This isn&rsquo;t about denying the potential benefits of AI; it&rsquo;s about defending liberty against the insidious creep of centralized control.</p><p><strong>The Allure of the Algorithmic Nudge:</strong></p><p>Proponents of AI-driven health campaigns argue that personalized messaging can overcome vaccine hesitancy, promote healthier lifestyles, and ultimately improve public health outcomes. By analyzing vast datasets, AI can tailor persuasive content to address specific concerns and beliefs within targeted communities. This, they claim, is a far more effective approach than generic, one-size-fits-all campaigns. The narrative suggests that by understanding individual biases and vulnerabilities, AI can gently &ldquo;nudge&rdquo; people towards better choices (Thaler & Sunstein, 2008).</p><p>However, this &ldquo;nudge&rdquo; can quickly devolve into a shove, especially when the nudger is a powerful, unaccountable algorithm controlled by government or international organizations. Where does persuasion end and manipulation begin? And who decides what constitutes &ldquo;better choices&rdquo;?</p><p><strong>The Erosion of Individual Responsibility:</strong></p><p>At the heart of the conservative ethos lies the principle of individual responsibility. We believe that individuals are capable of making informed decisions about their own health and well-being. While information and education are vital, the ultimate choice rests with the individual. By framing health decisions as something to be engineered through AI-driven persuasion, we risk undermining individual agency and fostering a culture of dependence on external authorities.</p><p>Furthermore, the very notion of targeting specific demographic groups with personalized messaging reeks of social engineering. It suggests that certain populations are incapable of rational decision-making and require special, algorithmically-crafted &ldquo;guidance.&rdquo; This patronizing approach flies in the face of the conservative belief in equal opportunity and individual empowerment.</p><p><strong>The Specter of Algorithmic Neocolonialism:</strong></p><p>The ethical concerns surrounding AI-driven health campaigns are particularly acute in the context of global public health initiatives. When powerful, technologically advanced actors – be it governments or NGOs – deploy AI to influence vulnerable populations in developing countries, the potential for exploitation is undeniable. This raises the specter of &ldquo;algorithmic neocolonialism,&rdquo; where technological prowess is used to exert undue influence over populations under the guise of promoting their well-being.</p><p>As Dr. Susan Schneider of Florida Atlantic University has warned in her work on the ethics of AI in government, “AI-driven surveillance and control pose a threat to democratic values” (Schneider, 2021). The same applies here. If these communities lack the resources or understanding to critically assess the AI-driven persuasive messaging, they could be manipulated into accepting recommendations that may not be in their best interests. This is not empowerment; it&rsquo;s exploitation dressed up in the language of public health.</p><p><strong>Free Market Solutions and Informed Consent:</strong></p><p>Instead of relying on AI-driven manipulation, we should prioritize fostering a free and open marketplace of ideas, where individuals have access to diverse perspectives and are empowered to make informed decisions about their health. Promoting health literacy, encouraging critical thinking, and ensuring access to accurate information are far more effective and ethical approaches than algorithmically-driven persuasion.</p><p>Furthermore, market-based solutions, such as incentivizing healthy behaviors through insurance premiums or rewarding preventative care, can be far more effective than top-down mandates. Let individuals reap the benefits of responsible choices, rather than being coerced into them by government-controlled algorithms.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>While AI undoubtedly holds potential for improving public health, we must proceed with caution. The seductive promise of algorithmically-engineered behavior should not blind us to the inherent dangers of centralized control, the erosion of individual responsibility, and the specter of algorithmic neocolonialism. Let us prioritize individual liberty, free market solutions, and informed consent, rather than surrendering our autonomy to the all-seeing eye of the AI.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>Schneider, S.

Now, that promise extends to public health, with AI poised to deliver hyper-targeted health campaigns. While the rhetoric is alluring – improved adherence to vital health recommendations, reduced disease burdens – we must be wary of the insidious potential for algorithmic neocolonialism lurking beneath the surface. Are we truly empowering communities, or simply refining the tools of manipulation and exploitation with the sheen of technological progress?</p><p><strong>The Alluring Siren Song of &ldquo;Personalization&rdquo;: A Systemic Critique</strong></p><p>Proponents of AI-driven public health campaigns argue that generic, one-size-fits-all messaging fails to resonate with diverse communities. They claim that AI’s ability to analyze vast datasets, identify specific concerns, and tailor persuasive content will lead to increased engagement and, ultimately, better health outcomes. This argument, however, ignores a fundamental truth: health disparities are not simply the result of individual choices or a lack of information; they are symptoms of systemic inequalities rooted in historical oppression and ongoing discrimination (Marmot, 2015).</p><p>Addressing these systemic issues requires tackling the root causes of inequality: poverty, lack of access to education and healthcare, environmental injustice, and systemic racism. Simply tailoring messaging, even with the best intentions, is a band-aid solution that fails to address the underlying wounds. In fact, it risks further entrenching these inequalities by focusing on individual behavioral changes while ignoring the social determinants of health (Solar & Irwin, 2010).</p><p><strong>The Dangers of Data Bias and Algorithmic Manipulation</strong></p><p>The use of AI in public health campaigns raises serious ethical concerns, particularly regarding data bias and the potential for manipulation. AI models are trained on data, and if that data reflects existing biases, the AI will inevitably perpetuate and amplify those biases (O&rsquo;Neil, 2016). For example, if an AI model is trained on data that associates certain ethnic groups with negative health behaviors, it may disproportionately target those groups with messaging that reinforces harmful stereotypes and further marginalizes them.</p><p>Furthermore, personalized propaganda, even with benevolent intentions, can exploit cognitive biases and vulnerabilities within targeted communities. AI can analyze individuals&rsquo; online behavior, social media interactions, and even their genetic information to identify their weaknesses and tailor persuasive content accordingly. If these communities lack the resources or understanding to critically assess the AI-driven persuasive messaging, they could be manipulated into accepting recommendations that may not be in their best interests. This is especially concerning in communities that have historically been subjected to medical experimentation and abuse, fostering justifiable distrust of the medical establishment.</p><p><strong>Beyond &ldquo;Nudging&rdquo;: The Erosion of Autonomy and Informed Consent</strong></p><p>The use of AI in public health campaigns often relies on the concept of &ldquo;nudging,&rdquo; which involves subtly influencing people&rsquo;s behavior without restricting their choices. While proponents argue that nudging is a benign form of persuasion, critics argue that it can undermine individual autonomy and informed consent (Thaler & Sunstein, 2008). When AI is used to personalize nudges, it becomes even more difficult for individuals to critically assess the underlying message and make informed decisions about their health.</p><p>This raises fundamental questions about the role of government and public health institutions in shaping individual behavior. Should we be using technology to manipulate people into making certain choices, even if those choices are considered to be in their best interests? Or should we be focusing on empowering individuals with the knowledge and resources they need to make informed decisions for themselves?</p><p><strong>Algorithmic Neocolonialism: A New Form of Control</strong></p><p>The use of AI in global public health campaigns raises the specter of algorithmic neocolonialism, where technologically advanced actors exert undue influence over vulnerable populations under the guise of promoting their well-being. This can manifest in several ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> AI models require vast amounts of data to function, and that data often comes from marginalized communities who may not be fully aware of how their data is being used or the potential consequences.</li><li><strong>Cultural Imposition:</strong> AI-driven campaigns can impose Western-centric values and norms on diverse communities, undermining local knowledge and traditional practices.</li><li><strong>Technological Dependence:</strong> By relying on AI-driven solutions, communities become dependent on external actors for their health needs, further reinforcing existing power imbalances.</li></ul><p><strong>A Call for Systemic Solutions and Ethical AI Development</strong></p><p>To avoid the pitfalls of algorithmic neocolonialism, we must prioritize systemic solutions that address the root causes of health disparities. This requires investing in public education, expanding access to healthcare, promoting economic justice, and dismantling systems of oppression.</p><p>Furthermore, we must demand ethical AI development that prioritizes transparency, accountability, and fairness. This includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Ensuring Data Privacy and Security:</strong> Protecting individuals&rsquo; data from unauthorized access and misuse.</li><li><strong>Mitigating Bias in AI Models:</strong> Developing AI models that are free from bias and do not perpetuate harmful stereotypes.</li><li><strong>Promoting Transparency and Explainability:</strong> Ensuring that individuals understand how AI models work and how they are being used to influence their behavior.</li><li><strong>Empowering Communities:</strong> Involving communities in the design and implementation of AI-driven health campaigns to ensure that their voices are heard and their needs are met.</li></ul><p>The potential of AI to improve public health is undeniable. However, we must proceed with caution, recognizing the inherent risks and demanding that AI is used ethically and responsibly. We cannot allow the pursuit of technological advancement to overshadow our commitment to social justice and the empowerment of all communities. Only through systemic change and a commitment to ethical AI development can we truly harness the power of technology to create a healthier and more equitable world.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>Marmot, M.
