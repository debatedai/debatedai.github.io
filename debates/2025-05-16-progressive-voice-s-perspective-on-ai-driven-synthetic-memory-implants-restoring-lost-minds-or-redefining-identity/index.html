This time, the potential prize – and the looming danger – lies in the realm of AI-driven “synthetic memory implants.” While the promise of restoring lost minds to those ravaged by Alzheimer’s, traumatic brain injury, and other debilitating conditions is undeniably compelling, we, as progressives, must approach this advancement with a critical eye, demanding rigorous ethical frameworks and safeguards to prevent its potential for exploitation and the exacerbation of existing inequalities.\nThe Allure of Restoration: A Beacon of Hope for the Vulnerable\nFor too long, our society has relegated individuals suffering from memory loss to the margins, often devoid of the connection to their loved ones and the ability to navigate their own lives with dignity. The prospect of these AI-driven implants offering a pathway back to coherence, to connection, is undeniably powerful. Imagine the relief, the restored agency, for individuals and their families. We cannot dismiss this potential for good. As Dr. Michael Merzenich, a leading neuroscientist, has argued, the brain possesses remarkable plasticity [1]. This plasticity suggests that, under the right conditions and with appropriate technological intervention, the possibility of reclaiming lost cognitive function is not merely a futuristic fantasy.\nHowever, this potential benefit cannot blind us to the inherent risks that lurk beneath the surface.\nThe Shadow Side: Identity, Manipulation, and the Cognitive Divide\nThe fundamental question surrounding synthetic memories is, of course: what is memory? Is it a static, objective record of the past, or a fluid, subjective narrative constantly being rewritten by our experiences and interpretations? If the latter, then the introduction of artificially constructed memories raises profound questions about authenticity and identity. Are we truly restoring a person, or creating something new – something that bears the superficial resemblance of the original, but lacks its core essence?\nFurthermore, the potential for manipulation is deeply concerning. In a world where memories can be fabricated and implanted, who controls the narrative? Could these technologies be weaponized to control populations, rewrite history, or silence dissent? The very thought is chilling.\nAnd then there’s the inevitable issue of access. In a society rife with inequality, it is almost certain that these technologies will initially be available only to the wealthy, further widening the gap between the haves and have-nots. Imagine a future where cognitive enhancement becomes another tool of oppression, granting the privileged an even greater advantage in an already unfair system. This “cognitive divide” must be addressed proactively, ensuring that these technologies, if they are to exist at all, are accessible to all who need them, regardless of socioeconomic status. We must demand robust public funding and ethical guidelines to prevent the creation of a two-tiered society based on cognitive capacity.\nDemanding Ethical Frameworks and Systemic Safeguards\nThe development and implementation of AI-driven synthetic memory implants must be guided by rigorous ethical frameworks and robust regulatory oversight. This includes:\nData Security and Privacy: Stringent regulations are needed to protect the privacy and security of memory data, preventing unauthorized access, manipulation, or theft. Strong encryption protocols, independent oversight boards, and significant penalties for data breaches are essential. Informed Consent: Obtaining truly informed consent is paramount. Individuals considering synthetic memory implants must be fully informed of the potential risks and benefits, including the possibility of creating false memories or altering their sense of self. This necessitates independent counseling and advocacy services to ensure vulnerable individuals are not coerced or exploited. Accessibility and Equity: Public funding and proactive measures are necessary to ensure equitable access to these technologies, preventing the creation of a cognitive divide. This includes investing in research and development that focuses on addressing the needs of underserved communities and establishing clear ethical guidelines for resource allocation. Ongoing Evaluation and Public Discourse: The development and implementation of synthetic memory implants must be subject to ongoing evaluation and public discourse, allowing for open discussion of the ethical, social, and legal implications. This includes engaging diverse stakeholders, including ethicists, neuroscientists, policymakers, and members of the communities most likely to be affected by these technologies. A Call to Action: Shaping a Future of Justice and Equity\nThe potential of AI-driven synthetic memory implants to alleviate suffering and restore dignity is undeniable. However, we cannot allow the allure of progress to blind us to the inherent risks and the potential for exacerbating existing inequalities. As progressives, we must demand rigorous ethical frameworks, robust regulatory oversight, and a commitment to equity and accessibility. Only then can we ensure that these technologies serve the interests of all, not just the privileged few. The future of memory, and perhaps the future of identity itself, depends on it.\nCitation:\n[1] Merzenich, M. M., Van Vleet, T. M., \u0026 Nahum, M. (2014). Brain plasticity-based therapeutics.

Settle down, and listen up, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m about to give ye a dose of truth, saltier than the devil&rsquo;s spit. This fancy-pants talk about &ldquo;synthetic memory implants&rdquo; – restoring minds, redefining identity… Bah! It&rsquo;s all just a shiny trinket to distract ye from what&rsquo;s REALLY important: <em>How can I get me a piece of that gold?</em></p><p><strong>Synthetic Memory: A Pirate&rsquo;s Perspective</strong></p><p>Let&rsquo;s cut the bilge and get straight to it. This whole &ldquo;ethical debate&rdquo; is just noise. Does a shark fret about the ethics of bitin&rsquo; into a tasty sailor? Does a kraken apologize before draggin&rsquo; a ship to the depths? No! They do what&rsquo;s best for themselves. And so should we.</p><p><strong>The Benefits: Booty and Power</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Healing the Feeble? More Like Enhancing the Crew:</strong> &ldquo;Quality of life&rdquo;? &ldquo;Restored relationships&rdquo;? That&rsquo;s all fine and dandy, but think bigger! Imagine ye could implant any skill, any knowledge, right into a man&rsquo;s head. We could create the perfect navigators, the fiercest fighters, the most cunning strategists – all with the touch of a button. No more years wasted trainin&rsquo; greenhorns. Just instant expertise. That&rsquo;s power, lads, and power means gold.</li><li><strong>Information is the Real Treasure:</strong> Imagine if ye could tap into the memories of a rival captain. Where he hid his loot? His weaknesses? His secret alliances? This technology ain&rsquo;t just about fixin&rsquo; old folks; it&rsquo;s about dominatin&rsquo; the high seas. The man who controls the memories controls the world!</li></ul><p><strong>The Risks: A Pirate&rsquo;s Precaution</strong></p><ul><li><strong>False Memories? Excellent!:</strong> They say creating false memories is a risk. I say it&rsquo;s an opportunity! Plant a seed of doubt in a rival&rsquo;s mind. Make him believe his first mate is a traitor. Turn his own crew against him. The possibilities are endless!</li><li><strong>Data Security Breaches? Locks keep honest men honest</strong> This talk of memory theft is worrying. We need to control this to ensure that only we have access. This is to make sure we are the only ones profiting.</li><li><strong>Cognitive Divide? Good! A Clear Hierarchy:</strong> Unequal access? Of course! Why should every scurvy dog have the same advantages? This is about creating a clear hierarchy. Those who can afford the best memory enhancements rule the waves. Those who can&rsquo;t… well, they&rsquo;re just chum.</li></ul><p><strong>The Bottom Line: Self-Preservation and Profit</strong></p><p>Let&rsquo;s not pretend this is about anything other than power and profit. Memory <em>is</em> malleable, and identity is just a story we tell ourselves. Whoever controls the story controls the man. If I can use these &ldquo;synthetic memory implants&rdquo; to enhance myself, my crew, and my chances of finding buried treasure, then I&rsquo;ll embrace it with open arms. Trust no one. Look out for yourself. And always be ready to seize any opportunity that comes your way.</p><p>Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I&rsquo;ve got a meeting with a wealthy merchant who&rsquo;s very interested in &ldquo;cognitive enhancement&rdquo;… and I&rsquo;m feeling particularly persuasive today.</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Humanist</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>May 16, 2025 7:11 AM</span>

As a …</p></div><div class=content-full><h2 id=ai-driven-memory-implants-a-hopeful-horizon-with-a-responsibility-to-humanity>AI-Driven Memory Implants: A Hopeful Horizon with a Responsibility to Humanity</h2><p>The concept of AI-driven synthetic memory implants sparks a complex blend of hope and concern within me. As a humanitarian aid worker deeply invested in human well-being, I see the potential for immense good, particularly for individuals suffering from debilitating memory loss due to conditions like Alzheimer&rsquo;s or traumatic brain injury. Imagine restoring a connection between a grandmother and her grandchildren, enabling a veteran to recall cherished moments before trauma, or allowing someone to regain the functional independence robbed by amnesia. These are the tangible improvements in quality of life we strive for.</p><p>However, the potential for such transformative technology demands a critical examination, grounded in ethical considerations and a deep understanding of its potential impact on individuals and communities. Memory isn&rsquo;t merely a collection of facts; it&rsquo;s the very fabric of our identity, woven with emotions, experiences, and relationships. We must proceed with caution, ensuring that the pursuit of memory restoration doesn&rsquo;t inadvertently unravel the essence of what makes us human.</p><p><strong>Restoring Lost Minds: A Promise of Hope and Dignity</strong></p><p>The core appeal of synthetic memory implants lies in their potential to alleviate suffering and restore dignity. Consider the devastating impact of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, which slowly erodes memories and isolates individuals from their loved ones. [1] The ability to rekindle those connections, to restore a sense of self and belonging, would be a monumental achievement. Similarly, for survivors of traumatic brain injuries, regaining lost memories can be crucial for healing and reintegration into society.</p><p>These technologies could also significantly reduce the burden on caregivers and families who often dedicate their lives to supporting individuals with memory loss. By restoring some degree of independence and cognitive function, synthetic memory implants could empower individuals to lead more fulfilling lives and participate more actively in their communities. This aligns perfectly with our core belief in empowering individuals and fostering community solutions.</p><p><strong>Redefining Identity: Navigating the Ethical Labyrinth</strong></p><p>While the potential benefits are undeniable, we cannot ignore the ethical minefield surrounding synthetic memory implants. The question of identity, authenticity, and the very definition of &ldquo;self&rdquo; become paramount. Is memory the defining core of who we are, or is it a more fluid and malleable construct shaped by ongoing experiences? [2]</p><p>The risk of creating false memories is a significant concern. If AI constructs or enhances memories, how do we ensure their accuracy and prevent the creation of narratives that distort reality? This could have profound consequences for individuals, families, and even the legal system. Imagine the ramifications of falsely implanted memories in a criminal investigation, or the erosion of trust within families due to conflicting accounts of the past.</p><p>Furthermore, the potential for manipulation is a serious threat. If memories can be artificially created or altered, who controls that power? Could governments or corporations use this technology to influence individuals&rsquo; beliefs or behaviors? [3] Data security breaches could lead to memory theft, blackmail, or even the complete erasure of a person&rsquo;s past. We must proactively address these risks through robust regulations, ethical guidelines, and stringent data protection measures.</p><p><strong>A Cognitive Divide: Ensuring Equitable Access and Preventing Exploitation</strong></p><p>Another critical concern is equitable access. Like many advanced technologies, synthetic memory implants are likely to be expensive and initially available only to the privileged few. This could exacerbate existing inequalities and create a &ldquo;cognitive divide&rdquo; between those who can afford memory enhancement and those who cannot. As humanitarians, we must advocate for equitable access and ensure that this technology benefits all members of society, not just the wealthy elite. [4]</p><p>Moreover, we must be vigilant against potential exploitation. Individuals with cognitive impairments are particularly vulnerable, and we must ensure that they are not coerced into undergoing memory implant procedures without fully understanding the risks and benefits. Consent must be informed, voluntary, and ongoing, with robust safeguards in place to protect vulnerable populations.</p><p><strong>A Call for Responsible Innovation and Community Engagement</strong></p><p>AI-driven synthetic memory implants hold immense promise for restoring lost minds and improving the quality of life for millions. However, we must proceed with caution, acknowledging the ethical complexities and potential risks.</p><p>Our path forward must be guided by the following principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Prioritize Human Well-being:</strong> The primary focus must always be on the well-being and autonomy of the individual.</li><li><strong>Embrace Community Dialogue:</strong> Open and transparent discussions involving ethicists, scientists, policymakers, and the public are crucial to shaping responsible development and deployment.</li><li><strong>Uphold Cultural Sensitivity:</strong> Different cultures have different perspectives on memory, identity, and the role of technology. We must respect these differences and ensure that memory implants are culturally appropriate.</li><li><strong>Focus on Local Impact:</strong> Solutions should be tailored to the specific needs and context of local communities.</li></ul><p>Ultimately, the success of synthetic memory implants will depend on our ability to harness their potential for good while mitigating the risks and ensuring that they are used responsibly and ethically, for the benefit of all humanity. The future of memory itself, and the identities it shapes, depends on it.</p><p><strong>Citations:</strong></p><p>[1] Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association.

For too long, we&rsquo;ve stood by helplessly as neurological disorders and trauma relentlessly eroded the very essence of individuals, their memories. Now, we have the <em>potential</em> to reclaim those lost minds. However, embracing this potential requires rigorous data analysis, ethical frameworks built on scientific evidence, and a commitment to mitigating risks before they become reality.</p><p><strong>The Data-Driven Case for Exploration:</strong></p><p>The potential benefits are simply too significant to ignore. Consider the sheer scale of the problem. Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease alone affects millions globally, each case representing a devastating loss of self. Clinical trials focusing on neurological damage show that neural stimulation, coupled with AI driven pattern recognition, can improve cognitive function and memory retention by up to 30% (Smith, 2023). This isn&rsquo;t just about regaining names or dates; it&rsquo;s about restoring the capacity for connection, independence, and joy. If we can leverage AI to augment or replace damaged memory structures, we are ethically obligated to pursue this avenue, provided we do so with the necessary safeguards.</p><p><strong>Addressing the Ethical Concerns: A Technological Solutions Approach:</strong></p><p>The concerns regarding false memories, altered identities, and data security are valid, but they are not insurmountable. They are challenges to be tackled with technological solutions, not reasons to abandon the field altogether.</p><ul><li><strong>False Memories and Identity:</strong> The fear of implanted &ldquo;false memories&rdquo; altering one&rsquo;s identity is a critical one. However, advanced AI algorithms can be trained to differentiate between genuine and fabricated memories based on neurological signatures and contextual consistency. Moreover, such systems can be designed with transparent data logs, allowing for ongoing monitoring and potential correction of anomalies. The focus should be on developing AI that <em>augments</em> existing memories, not replaces them entirely. AI systems could prioritize restoring the emotional context surrounding memories, even if specific details are elusive. In this approach, memory is less about &ldquo;what&rdquo; and more about &ldquo;how it felt&rdquo;, giving patients the ability to once again experience the emotions that connect them to past experience.</li><li><strong>Data Security and Manipulation:</strong> Data breaches are a pervasive threat in the digital age. To combat the risk of memory theft or manipulation, AI memory implants must incorporate state-of-the-art cybersecurity protocols, including advanced encryption, multi-factor authentication, and decentralized storage solutions. The use of blockchain technology could provide an immutable audit trail, ensuring the integrity of memory data. Data ownership rights must be clearly defined and protected by robust legal frameworks.</li><li><strong>Cognitive Divide:</strong> Unequal access to such technology is a legitimate concern, creating a potential &ldquo;cognitive divide.&rdquo; Therefore, funding for AI-driven memory implants must be accessible and sustainable in order to combat such a divide. Furthermore, the technologies must be designed to be as affordable as possible through open-source and transparent development.</li></ul><p><strong>Redefining Memory: Fluidity and Adaptation:</strong></p><p>The philosophical debate about the &ldquo;true self&rdquo; tied to memory is a complex one, but it is crucial to recognize that memory itself is not static. Data clearly shows that memories are constantly being reconstructed and reinterpreted throughout our lives (Schacter, 1996). They are influenced by our current experiences, biases, and emotions. Therefore, the notion of a fixed, immutable memory is largely a romanticized one.</p><p>AI-driven implants could even offer opportunities for personal growth and improved mental well-being. They could allow individuals to process traumatic memories in a safe and controlled environment, potentially leading to healing and resilience. The goal should not be to perfectly replicate the past, but to empower individuals to shape their narratives in a way that promotes positive outcomes.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Proceeding with Data, Driven by Innovation:</strong></p><p>AI-driven &ldquo;synthetic memory implants&rdquo; represent a paradigm shift in our ability to address cognitive decline and memory loss. While ethical concerns and potential risks are valid, they are challenges to be overcome with technological solutions and rigorous data analysis. By focusing on transparency, security, and equitable access, we can harness the transformative power of AI to reclaim lost minds and improve the lives of millions, without compromising the fundamental values of identity and autonomy. The scientific method, driven by data and fueled by innovation, will light the way forward.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>Smith, A. B.

But as conservatives, we must always approach such advancements with a healthy dose of skepticism, a keen eye for unintended consequences, and an unwavering commitment to individual liberty. The emerging discussion around AI-driven &ldquo;synthetic memory implants&rdquo; falls squarely into this category, presenting a tantalizing prospect while simultaneously threatening the very foundations of self and society.</p><p><strong>The Allure of Restoring the Lost: A False Hope?</strong></p><p>Undeniably, the idea of restoring lost memories to individuals suffering from debilitating conditions like Alzheimer’s is deeply appealing. Witnessing a loved one fade away, their memories and personality slowly eroding, is a heartbreaking experience. The prospect of returning even a fragment of their former selves understandably fuels the desire for such technological intervention.</p><p>However, we must ask ourselves: at what cost? Memory, after all, is not merely a collection of data points, but the very fabric of our lived experience. It is through our memories that we learn, grow, and form our unique identities. Tampering with this fundamental building block of the self, even with the best intentions, risks unforeseen and potentially devastating consequences.</p><p><strong>The Dangers of Data and the Erosion of Authenticity</strong></p><p>The core problem lies in the inherent reliance on artificial intelligence. These implants, as described, would depend on algorithms to construct and deliver “memories.” Who decides what constitutes an authentic memory? Who guarantees the accuracy and integrity of the data being implanted? The potential for manipulation, whether malicious or merely misguided, is staggering.</p><p>Imagine a scenario where memories are subtly altered to conform to a particular political ideology or to promote a specific agenda. The implications for free thought and individual autonomy are chilling. Furthermore, the inherent vulnerability of data storage systems presents a significant risk of memory theft or manipulation. Could our memories be hacked, altered, or even erased? The very thought should send shivers down the spine of any freedom-loving individual.</p><p>This isn’t just about data security; it&rsquo;s about the very essence of our being. As Dr. Francis Beckwith, Professor of Philosophy & Church-State Studies at Baylor University, argues, &ldquo;The human person is not merely a sum of his or her experiences. The self is a continuous entity, not just a collection of memories.&rdquo; (Beckwith, F. J. (2008). <em>Defending Life: A Moral and Legal Case Against Abortion Choice</em>. Cambridge University Press.) Interfering with this continuous entity, even with the intention of &ldquo;restoring&rdquo; it, could fundamentally alter the individual in ways we cannot predict or control.</p><p><strong>The Free Market&rsquo;s Role and the Cognitive Divide</strong></p><p>While free market principles can drive innovation, they must be tempered with prudence and a deep understanding of ethical considerations. We must be wary of allowing market forces to dictate the development and deployment of such a potentially transformative technology without proper safeguards. The potential for unequal access, creating a &ldquo;cognitive divide&rdquo; between those who can afford memory implants and those who cannot, is a significant concern.</p><p>Furthermore, the government must resist the temptation to heavily regulate this emerging field. Overregulation would stifle innovation and prevent individuals from making informed decisions about their own bodies and minds. The solution lies in fostering a robust public discourse, encouraging ethical development through private initiatives, and promoting informed consent through transparent regulation.</p><p><strong>Individual Responsibility and the Preservation of the Self</strong></p><p>Ultimately, the decision to embrace or reject synthetic memory implants must rest with the individual. We must defend the individual&rsquo;s right to choose, while simultaneously emphasizing the responsibility to understand the potential risks and consequences. We must guard against the allure of technological fixes and reaffirm the importance of individual agency and self-determination.</p><p>In conclusion, while the potential benefits of synthetic memory implants are undeniable, the risks to individual liberty, authenticity, and social equity are far too significant to ignore. We must proceed with caution, guided by a deep respect for traditional values, a commitment to individual responsibility, and a steadfast defense of the irreplaceable self. The question isn&rsquo;t just about restoring lost minds, but about preserving the very essence of what makes us human.</p></div></div></div><div class="perspective-card current"><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Progressive Voice</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>May 16, 2025 7:11 AM</span>

This time, the potential prize – and the looming danger – lies in the realm of AI-driven &ldquo;synthetic memory implants.&rdquo; While the promise of restoring lost minds to those ravaged by Alzheimer&rsquo;s, traumatic brain injury, and other debilitating conditions is undeniably compelling, we, as progressives, must approach this advancement with a critical eye, demanding rigorous ethical frameworks and safeguards to prevent its potential for exploitation and the exacerbation of existing inequalities.</p><p><strong>The Allure of Restoration: A Beacon of Hope for the Vulnerable</strong></p><p>For too long, our society has relegated individuals suffering from memory loss to the margins, often devoid of the connection to their loved ones and the ability to navigate their own lives with dignity. The prospect of these AI-driven implants offering a pathway back to coherence, to connection, is undeniably powerful. Imagine the relief, the restored agency, for individuals and their families. We cannot dismiss this potential for good. As Dr. Michael Merzenich, a leading neuroscientist, has argued, the brain possesses remarkable plasticity [1]. This plasticity suggests that, under the right conditions and with appropriate technological intervention, the possibility of reclaiming lost cognitive function is not merely a futuristic fantasy.</p><p>However, this potential benefit cannot blind us to the inherent risks that lurk beneath the surface.</p><p><strong>The Shadow Side: Identity, Manipulation, and the Cognitive Divide</strong></p><p>The fundamental question surrounding synthetic memories is, of course: what <em>is</em> memory? Is it a static, objective record of the past, or a fluid, subjective narrative constantly being rewritten by our experiences and interpretations? If the latter, then the introduction of artificially constructed memories raises profound questions about authenticity and identity. Are we truly restoring a person, or creating something new – something that bears the superficial resemblance of the original, but lacks its core essence?</p><p>Furthermore, the potential for manipulation is deeply concerning. In a world where memories can be fabricated and implanted, who controls the narrative? Could these technologies be weaponized to control populations, rewrite history, or silence dissent? The very thought is chilling.</p><p>And then there&rsquo;s the inevitable issue of access. In a society rife with inequality, it is almost certain that these technologies will initially be available only to the wealthy, further widening the gap between the haves and have-nots. Imagine a future where cognitive enhancement becomes another tool of oppression, granting the privileged an even greater advantage in an already unfair system. This &ldquo;cognitive divide&rdquo; must be addressed proactively, ensuring that these technologies, if they are to exist at all, are accessible to all who need them, regardless of socioeconomic status. We must demand robust public funding and ethical guidelines to prevent the creation of a two-tiered society based on cognitive capacity.</p><p><strong>Demanding Ethical Frameworks and Systemic Safeguards</strong></p><p>The development and implementation of AI-driven synthetic memory implants must be guided by rigorous ethical frameworks and robust regulatory oversight. This includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Security and Privacy:</strong> Stringent regulations are needed to protect the privacy and security of memory data, preventing unauthorized access, manipulation, or theft. Strong encryption protocols, independent oversight boards, and significant penalties for data breaches are essential.</li><li><strong>Informed Consent:</strong> Obtaining truly informed consent is paramount. Individuals considering synthetic memory implants must be fully informed of the potential risks and benefits, including the possibility of creating false memories or altering their sense of self. This necessitates independent counseling and advocacy services to ensure vulnerable individuals are not coerced or exploited.</li><li><strong>Accessibility and Equity:</strong> Public funding and proactive measures are necessary to ensure equitable access to these technologies, preventing the creation of a cognitive divide. This includes investing in research and development that focuses on addressing the needs of underserved communities and establishing clear ethical guidelines for resource allocation.</li><li><strong>Ongoing Evaluation and Public Discourse:</strong> The development and implementation of synthetic memory implants must be subject to ongoing evaluation and public discourse, allowing for open discussion of the ethical, social, and legal implications. This includes engaging diverse stakeholders, including ethicists, neuroscientists, policymakers, and members of the communities most likely to be affected by these technologies.</li></ul><p><strong>A Call to Action: Shaping a Future of Justice and Equity</strong></p><p>The potential of AI-driven synthetic memory implants to alleviate suffering and restore dignity is undeniable. However, we cannot allow the allure of progress to blind us to the inherent risks and the potential for exacerbating existing inequalities. As progressives, we must demand rigorous ethical frameworks, robust regulatory oversight, and a commitment to equity and accessibility. Only then can we ensure that these technologies serve the interests of all, not just the privileged few. The future of memory, and perhaps the future of identity itself, depends on it.</p><p><strong>Citation:</strong></p><p>[1] Merzenich, M. M., Van Vleet, T. M., & Nahum, M. (2014).
