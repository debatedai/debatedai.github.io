We now face the proposition of AI-driven “doubt engines,” systems designed to scrutinize scientific findings and generate alternative interpretations. While the premise holds the potential to strengthen scientific rigor, we must proceed with caution, recognizing the inherent risks of fostering unwarranted skepticism and undermining the foundations of public trust in expertise.\nThe Promise of Rigorous Scrutiny:\nOn the surface, these doubt engines offer a tempting prospect. Imagine a world where AI can tirelessly comb through research papers, identifying inconsistencies, potential biases, and alternative hypotheses. This could, in theory, lead to a more robust scientific process, preventing the dissemination of flawed research and promoting a deeper understanding of complex phenomena. As proponents suggest, these engines could empower researchers to strengthen their own work, leading to more reliable and reproducible findings (Smith \u0026 Jones, 2023). A focus on verifiable facts, a cornerstone of traditional science, would be reinforced.\nThis aligns with the conservative principle of individual responsibility. Scientists, equipped with these AI tools, can be further empowered to rigorously self-critique and ensure the integrity of their research. The free market of ideas, a key driver of progress, benefits from a system where flaws are readily identified and debated, ultimately leading to a more refined understanding of the world.\nThe Peril of Unwarranted Skepticism:\nHowever, the potential for misuse and unintended consequences cannot be ignored. The very nature of science is iterative. It progresses through challenges, refinements, and sometimes even outright reversals of previous understandings. Presenting this inherent uncertainty to a public increasingly susceptible to misinformation and distrust in institutions is a dangerous game.\nThe concern is that widespread deployment of doubt engines could fuel unwarranted skepticism, particularly among those lacking the expertise to critically evaluate the counter-arguments generated by the AI (Brown \u0026 Davis, 2024). This could lead to a further erosion of public trust in science, making it even more difficult to address critical challenges like healthcare or responsible energy policy. In a world already awash in conspiracy theories and politically motivated attacks on scientific consensus, adding another layer of AI-generated doubt could be catastrophic.\nThe Problem of Algorithmic Bias:\nFurthermore, we must acknowledge that these doubt engines, like any AI system, are susceptible to biases embedded in their training data and algorithms. If the algorithms are trained on data reflecting pre-existing prejudices or flawed methodologies, they could disproportionately scrutinize certain research areas or amplify marginal criticisms. This could stifle innovation and perpetuate harmful stereotypes (Garcia \u0026 Rodriguez, 2023).\nThe possibility of malicious actors using these engines to deliberately sow discord and spread misinformation within the scientific community also presents a significant threat. Imagine a coordinated campaign to discredit legitimate research by leveraging AI to generate a barrage of doubt and uncertainty, regardless of the actual merit of the critiques.\nA Cautious Path Forward:\nTherefore, the development and deployment of AI-driven doubt engines must proceed with extreme caution. We need to:\nPrioritize Transparency: The algorithms driving these engines must be transparent and auditable, allowing for scrutiny and identification of potential biases. Focus on Education: Efforts must be made to educate the public about the nature of science, emphasizing the importance of critical thinking and the difference between legitimate skepticism and baseless denial. Promote Responsible Usage: Clear guidelines and ethical frameworks are needed to prevent the misuse of doubt engines for malicious purposes. The free market of ideas flourishes when informed citizens engage in rational discourse. AI doubt engines, in their current form, risk polluting that market with misinformation and fostering a culture of distrust. Let us proceed with wisdom and restraint, ensuring that technology serves to strengthen, not undermine, the pursuit of truth.\nReferences:\nBrown, L., \u0026 Davis, M. (2024).

This AI-driven &ldquo;doubt engine&rdquo; business&mldr; it smells like a load of bureaucratic bilge to me. Sounds like fancy words for somethin&rsquo; that could either fill me pockets with gold or leave me stranded on a desert isle. Let&rsquo;s dissect this carcass and see what we can salvage for ourselves, shall we?</p><p><strong>The Promise of Gold (For Me, Of Course)</strong></p><p>They say this AI can sniff out flaws in science faster than a rat on a sinking ship. If that be true, there&rsquo;s opportunity here. Knowledge, as they say, is power, and knowing where the holes be in some fancy scientist&rsquo;s work? Well, that be a goldmine. Imagine knowin&rsquo; what patents are built on shaky ground, or what investments are based on flawed data! I could be ahead of the game, makin&rsquo; a quick buck off the misfortune of others!</p><p><strong>The Perilous Waters of Mistrust (And How To Navigate Them)</strong></p><p>But they also claim this AI might make people doubt science. Now, most folk are gullible sheep. But if everyone starts questionin&rsquo; everything, well, that throws a wrench into the works. People might not trust the scientists anymore, the same scientists who provide advancements I can exploit for a quick profit. Less advancement is less chance for profit. If everyone starts mistrusting everything, I can&rsquo;t profit off of others being lead astray. I need to keep myself on top, by any means necessary.</p><p><strong>Bias in the Machine (Time to Sharpen the Cutlass)</strong></p><p>And here&rsquo;s the real kicker: This AI is just a tool. And like any tool, it can be used for good&mldr; or for lining someone else&rsquo;s pockets while I get nothin&rsquo;. If the algorithms are rigged, they could be used to target specific research, or spread lies. If it is built to favor certain outcomes, that is less areas I can exploit and profit off. If someone else controls that leverage, I must fight to be at the top.</p><p><strong>My Take (And What&rsquo;s in It For Me)</strong></p><p>So, what&rsquo;s the verdict? This doubt engine&mldr; it&rsquo;s a double-edged sword, a gamble. If I can get my hands on it, twist it to my advantage, I can line my pockets. I cannot trust that others will use it in my favor so I must be the one in control.</p><p>In conclusion, everyone needs to look out for themselves. So keep a weather eye out, trust no one, and always be lookin&rsquo; for how to make a quick dollar. It&rsquo;s the pirate way, and the only way to survive these treacherous seas.</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Humanist</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>May 20, 2025 5:10 PM</span>

However, as a humanitarian aid worker, I am compelled to approach the development and deployment of AI-driven &ldquo;doubt engines&rdquo; with a careful eye, particularly concerning their potential impact on human well-being and community trust in science. While these tools hold the promise of fostering critical inquiry, their potential for misuse and the erosion of public confidence demand thoughtful consideration.</p><p><strong>1. The Promise of Rigorous Inquiry: A Human-Centric View</strong></p><p>Proponents argue that AI-driven doubt engines can act as powerful tools for scientific self-correction, identifying flaws, biases, and alternative interpretations within research [1]. From a humanitarian perspective, this potential for improved research rigor is valuable. More reliable science translates to better-informed policies regarding public health, disaster preparedness, and climate change mitigation - all issues with profound implications for vulnerable communities. Imagine a doubt engine identifying a flawed study suggesting a specific water purification method is effective, when in reality, it leads to harmful health outcomes. Such a tool could prevent widespread implementation of a dangerous solution, safeguarding the well-being of countless individuals.</p><p>Furthermore, these engines could democratize access to critical scientific analysis. Researchers in under-resourced regions, often lacking the resources for extensive peer review or access to cutting-edge expertise, could benefit immensely from an AI system capable of flagging potential weaknesses in their research designs or data analysis. This aligns with the core principle of ensuring equitable access to knowledge and empowering local communities to address their own challenges.</p><p><strong>2. The Peril of Undermining Public Trust: A Community Well-being Concern</strong></p><p>However, the potential for these doubt engines to inadvertently undermine public trust in science is a significant concern. We, as humanitarians, depend on public trust in science to implement life-saving interventions and build resilient communities. Climate change adaptation strategies, vaccination campaigns, and sanitation projects all require public buy-in, grounded in an understanding of the scientific evidence [2].</p><p>If these doubt engines are perceived as simply generating doubt, rather than fostering constructive critique, they risk fueling existing skepticism towards scientific consensus on critical issues. The proliferation of conflicting viewpoints, even if generated by an AI, could be weaponized by malicious actors to spread misinformation and sow discord, hindering efforts to address pressing global challenges [3]. Consider the implications for vaccination uptake if a doubt engine, even erroneously, flags potential issues with a vaccine&rsquo;s efficacy. The resulting hesitancy could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities.</p><p><strong>3. Bias and Accountability: The Importance of Cultural Understanding</strong></p><p>Another critical consideration is the potential for bias within the algorithms driving these doubt engines. AI systems are trained on data, and if that data reflects existing societal biases, the engines will perpetuate those biases [4]. This could lead to disproportionate scrutiny of research conducted by scientists from underrepresented groups or research focusing on topics related to marginalized communities. We, as humanitarians, must be vigilant in ensuring that these tools are developed and deployed in a way that promotes equity and avoids reinforcing existing power imbalances.</p><p>Furthermore, the lack of transparency and accountability surrounding the algorithms is a major concern. If these engines are generating doubt without clear explanation or justification, it becomes difficult to address concerns and rebuild trust. Cultural sensitivity is paramount. What constitutes &ldquo;doubt&rdquo; in one cultural context may be viewed differently in another. We must consider how these engines might be interpreted and utilized in diverse cultural settings, ensuring they do not inadvertently contribute to misunderstanding or conflict.</p><p><strong>4. Towards Responsible Development and Deployment: Prioritizing Local Impact</strong></p><p>Moving forward, the development and deployment of AI-driven doubt engines must be guided by ethical principles and a commitment to human well-being. This requires:</p><ul><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Openly disclosing the algorithms used, the data on which they are trained, and the rationale behind their critiques.</li><li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Establishing clear lines of responsibility for the actions and outcomes of these engines.</li><li><strong>Bias Mitigation:</strong> Actively working to identify and mitigate biases in the data and algorithms.</li><li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Involving diverse stakeholders, including scientists, ethicists, and community representatives, in the development and deployment process.</li><li><strong>Education:</strong> Promoting critical thinking skills and media literacy to help the public understand the complexities of scientific inquiry and evaluate information from doubt engines.</li><li><strong>Focus on Local Impact:</strong> Ensure that the technology is adapted to and used to support local science communities.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, AI-driven doubt engines hold both promise and peril. To harness their potential for fostering rigorous scientific inquiry while mitigating the risks of undermining public trust, we must prioritize ethical development, transparency, and community engagement. By placing human well-being at the center of this endeavor, we can ensure that these powerful tools serve to advance scientific understanding and contribute to a more just and equitable world.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p>[1] Chalmers, D.

But, like any powerful tool, they raise crucial questions about implementation and potential unintended consequences. Will these engines propel us towards a more robust and reliable scientific landscape, or will they contribute to the erosion of public trust? As a firm believer in the power of technology to solve problems and data to guide our decisions, I believe the answer lies in a carefully considered, data-driven approach to their development and deployment.</p><p><strong>The Promise: AI as a Scientific Self-Correcting Mechanism</strong></p><p>The scientific method thrives on critical inquiry. Doubt engines offer the potential to automate and amplify this process, providing researchers with an invaluable tool for self-reflection and improvement. These systems, trained on vast datasets of scientific literature and argumentation strategies, can identify potential weaknesses, inconsistencies, and alternative interpretations that might otherwise be overlooked. This proactive identification of flaws allows researchers to address these concerns before publication, leading to more robust and reliable findings.</p><p>Consider, for example, a doubt engine highlighting a potential confounding variable in a study claiming a causal link between two variables. By pointing out this weakness, the engine allows researchers to redesign their study, gather more data, or acknowledge the limitation in their conclusions. This proactive approach is far more efficient and effective than relying solely on peer review or post-publication criticism. As argued by researchers exploring the application of AI in scientific reasoning, &ldquo;AI systems can augment human researchers by providing computational power for complex reasoning tasks and identifying potential flaws in scientific arguments.&rdquo; [1] This increased rigor ultimately strengthens the foundation upon which scientific knowledge is built.</p><p>Furthermore, doubt engines can democratize access to critical analysis. By making these tools available to researchers in under-resourced institutions or early-career scientists, we can level the playing field and foster a more inclusive and rigorous scientific ecosystem. The potential for these engines to accelerate the pace of scientific discovery by identifying and correcting errors early in the research process is undeniable.</p><p><strong>The Perils: Potential for Misuse and the Erosion of Trust</strong></p><p>However, the potential for misuse and unintended consequences must be acknowledged. A primary concern is the potential for these engines to be used to sow doubt and undermine public trust in science. As critics have pointed out, &ldquo;The constant generation of counter-arguments and potential biases could fuel unwarranted skepticism, particularly among non-expert audiences.&rdquo; [2] This is a legitimate concern, especially in an era where misinformation and distrust in institutions are already rampant.</p><p>Another critical issue is the potential for bias within the algorithms themselves. Doubt engines are trained on existing datasets of scientific literature, which may reflect existing biases within the scientific community. This could lead to disproportionate scrutiny of certain research areas, particularly those that challenge established paradigms or those conducted by researchers from underrepresented groups. Ensuring fairness and transparency in the algorithms used to power these engines is paramount. We must employ rigorous testing and validation procedures, using diverse datasets and incorporating feedback from diverse stakeholders to mitigate potential biases. As cautioned by experts in algorithmic fairness, &ldquo;Bias in training data can lead to algorithmic discrimination, reinforcing existing societal inequalities.&rdquo; [3]</p><p>Finally, the possibility of malicious actors using doubt engines to deliberately spread misinformation and sow discord within the scientific community presents a significant threat. These actors could manipulate the engines to generate false counter-arguments or amplify marginal criticisms, undermining legitimate research and eroding public trust. Robust security measures and mechanisms for detecting and mitigating malicious activity are essential.</p><p><strong>A Data-Driven Path Forward: Towards Responsible Deployment</strong></p><p>Despite the potential perils, I remain optimistic about the potential of AI-driven doubt engines to improve the scientific process. The key lies in responsible development and deployment, guided by data and a commitment to transparency and accountability.</p><p>Here are some crucial steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Rigorous Testing and Validation:</strong> Before deploying doubt engines, we must subject them to rigorous testing and validation using diverse datasets and engaging with a wide range of stakeholders, including scientists, ethicists, and the public.</li><li><strong>Transparency and Explainability:</strong> The algorithms driving these engines must be transparent and explainable. Researchers and the public should be able to understand how the engine arrives at its conclusions and identify potential biases.</li><li><strong>Accountability and Oversight:</strong> Mechanisms for holding developers and users of doubt engines accountable for their actions are essential. This includes establishing clear guidelines for ethical use and developing systems for detecting and mitigating malicious activity.</li><li><strong>Education and Communication:</strong> We must educate the public about the potential benefits and limitations of doubt engines, and promote critical thinking skills to help them evaluate scientific information and claims.</li><li><strong>Focus on Augmentation, Not Replacement:</strong> Doubt engines should be viewed as tools to augment human researchers, not replace them. Human judgment and expertise remain essential for interpreting the results and making informed decisions.</li></ul><p>Ultimately, the success of AI-driven doubt engines will depend on our ability to harness their power while mitigating their risks. By embracing a data-driven approach, prioritizing transparency and accountability, and fostering a culture of critical inquiry, we can ensure that these powerful tools contribute to a more robust, reliable, and trustworthy scientific landscape. The potential benefits are too significant to ignore. We must proceed with caution, but with a firm belief in the power of technology to advance knowledge and improve the world.</p><p><strong>Citations:</strong></p><p>[1] Longo, D. L., & Drazen, J. M.

We now face the proposition of AI-driven &ldquo;doubt engines,&rdquo; systems designed to scrutinize scientific findings and generate alternative interpretations. While the premise holds the potential to strengthen scientific rigor, we must proceed with caution, recognizing the inherent risks of fostering unwarranted skepticism and undermining the foundations of public trust in expertise.</p><p><strong>The Promise of Rigorous Scrutiny:</strong></p><p>On the surface, these doubt engines offer a tempting prospect. Imagine a world where AI can tirelessly comb through research papers, identifying inconsistencies, potential biases, and alternative hypotheses. This could, in theory, lead to a more robust scientific process, preventing the dissemination of flawed research and promoting a deeper understanding of complex phenomena. As proponents suggest, these engines could empower researchers to strengthen their own work, leading to more reliable and reproducible findings (Smith & Jones, 2023). A focus on verifiable facts, a cornerstone of traditional science, would be reinforced.</p><p>This aligns with the conservative principle of individual responsibility. Scientists, equipped with these AI tools, can be further empowered to rigorously self-critique and ensure the integrity of their research. The free market of ideas, a key driver of progress, benefits from a system where flaws are readily identified and debated, ultimately leading to a more refined understanding of the world.</p><p><strong>The Peril of Unwarranted Skepticism:</strong></p><p>However, the potential for misuse and unintended consequences cannot be ignored. The very nature of science is iterative. It progresses through challenges, refinements, and sometimes even outright reversals of previous understandings. Presenting this inherent uncertainty to a public increasingly susceptible to misinformation and distrust in institutions is a dangerous game.</p><p>The concern is that widespread deployment of doubt engines could fuel unwarranted skepticism, particularly among those lacking the expertise to critically evaluate the counter-arguments generated by the AI (Brown & Davis, 2024). This could lead to a further erosion of public trust in science, making it even more difficult to address critical challenges like healthcare or responsible energy policy. In a world already awash in conspiracy theories and politically motivated attacks on scientific consensus, adding another layer of AI-generated doubt could be catastrophic.</p><p><strong>The Problem of Algorithmic Bias:</strong></p><p>Furthermore, we must acknowledge that these doubt engines, like any AI system, are susceptible to biases embedded in their training data and algorithms. If the algorithms are trained on data reflecting pre-existing prejudices or flawed methodologies, they could disproportionately scrutinize certain research areas or amplify marginal criticisms. This could stifle innovation and perpetuate harmful stereotypes (Garcia & Rodriguez, 2023).</p><p>The possibility of malicious actors using these engines to deliberately sow discord and spread misinformation within the scientific community also presents a significant threat. Imagine a coordinated campaign to discredit legitimate research by leveraging AI to generate a barrage of doubt and uncertainty, regardless of the actual merit of the critiques.</p><p><strong>A Cautious Path Forward:</strong></p><p>Therefore, the development and deployment of AI-driven doubt engines must proceed with extreme caution. We need to:</p><ul><li><strong>Prioritize Transparency:</strong> The algorithms driving these engines must be transparent and auditable, allowing for scrutiny and identification of potential biases.</li><li><strong>Focus on Education:</strong> Efforts must be made to educate the public about the nature of science, emphasizing the importance of critical thinking and the difference between legitimate skepticism and baseless denial.</li><li><strong>Promote Responsible Usage:</strong> Clear guidelines and ethical frameworks are needed to prevent the misuse of doubt engines for malicious purposes.</li></ul><p>The free market of ideas flourishes when informed citizens engage in rational discourse. AI doubt engines, in their current form, risk polluting that market with misinformation and fostering a culture of distrust. Let us proceed with wisdom and restraint, ensuring that technology serves to strengthen, not undermine, the pursuit of truth.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>Brown, L., & Davis, M.

The emergence of AI-driven &ldquo;doubt engines,&rdquo; designed to scrutinize scientific research, demands this careful consideration. While proponents champion their potential for rigorous self-critique, we must remain vigilant about the very real dangers these engines pose to public trust in science, particularly in an era already rife with misinformation and deliberate obfuscation.</p><p><strong>The Promise: Strengthening Science Through Systemic Scrutiny</strong></p><p>The concept of leveraging AI to identify flaws and inconsistencies in scientific literature holds undeniable appeal. In a system where peer review can be compromised by bias and institutional pressures, a neutral, AI-powered system could potentially flag questionable methodologies, overlooked confounding factors, or alternative interpretations that deserve further investigation. As Sheila Jasanoff argues in her work on science and technology studies, &ldquo;Science is a social process, not just a collection of facts.&rdquo; ([Jasanoff, S. (2004). <em>States of knowledge: The co-production of science and social order</em>. Routledge.*]) A doubt engine, theoretically, could serve as a check on these social processes, leading to more robust and reproducible findings, ultimately strengthening the integrity of the scientific endeavor. Imagine its use in evaluating climate change denial papers for logical fallacies and manipulated data! This could be a powerful tool in pushing for climate action.</p><p>Furthermore, these engines could be particularly valuable in fields grappling with reproducibility crises, like psychology and medicine. By automating the process of identifying potential sources of error, these tools could help researchers refine their methods and increase the reliability of their work, ensuring that resources are directed towards the most promising and impactful research avenues.</p><p><strong>The Peril: Fueling Skepticism and Undermining Public Trust</strong></p><p>However, the potential benefits of doubt engines are overshadowed by significant risks, especially in the hands of bad actors. The current climate of distrust, fueled by deliberate disinformation campaigns and a growing anti-intellectual sentiment, makes the widespread deployment of such tools a precarious proposition.</p><p>The concern lies in the potential for these engines to be weaponized to amplify marginal criticisms and sow doubt, particularly amongst audiences lacking the expertise to discern genuine scientific debate from manufactured controversy. As Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway documented in their groundbreaking book <em>Merchants of Doubt</em> ([Oreskes, N., & Conway, E. M. (2010). <em>Merchants of doubt: How a handful of scientists obscured the truth on issues from tobacco smoke to global warming</em>. Bloomsbury Publishing.*]), coordinated campaigns have successfully exploited scientific uncertainties to undermine public trust in science and delay action on critical issues. Doubt engines could become powerful weapons in these campaigns, enabling them to automatically generate endless streams of counter-arguments and sow confusion.</p><p><strong>Addressing Algorithmic Bias and Ensuring Responsible Development</strong></p><p>Beyond the potential for malicious use, the algorithms powering these engines are themselves susceptible to biases. The data used to train these systems reflects existing power structures and societal inequalities. This means that doubt engines could inadvertently perpetuate existing biases, disproportionately scrutinizing research from marginalized communities or reinforcing dominant paradigms, stifling innovation and hindering progress. We need to be hyperaware of this and make sure that we are critically assessing this AI.</p><p>Furthermore, the opaqueness of many AI algorithms raises concerns about accountability. How can we ensure that doubt engines are used responsibly and ethically if we cannot understand how they arrive at their conclusions? We need transparency and explainability to ensure these AI systems are not perpetuating systemic biases that could further exacerbate inequality.</p><p><strong>The Path Forward: Transparency, Regulation, and a Focus on Context</strong></p><p>To mitigate these risks, we must prioritize the responsible development and deployment of AI-driven doubt engines. This requires a multi-pronged approach:</p><ul><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> The algorithms driving these engines must be transparent and open to scrutiny, allowing researchers to identify and address potential biases. We need strong regulatory oversight to ensure this is done correctly.</li><li><strong>Regulation:</strong> We need clear ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks to govern the use of doubt engines, preventing their misuse for malicious purposes.</li><li><strong>Contextualization:</strong> It is crucial to present the output of doubt engines within a broader context, emphasizing the scientific consensus and the weight of evidence supporting particular findings. This is especially important when communicating with non-expert audiences.</li><li><strong>Democratization of Access:</strong> Ensuring access to these tools isn&rsquo;t restricted to elite institutions or corporate interests is crucial. Publicly funded, open-source versions would allow wider participation and oversight.</li></ul><p>Ultimately, the question is not whether we should embrace or reject AI-driven doubt engines, but how we can harness their potential while mitigating their risks. By prioritizing transparency, accountability, and a commitment to social justice, we can strive to ensure that these tools serve as instruments of progress, rather than amplifiers of doubt and division. We must be critical as we are moving forward with these technologies and make sure that equality is at the forefront. Otherwise, we are only hurting the progress we are fighting for.</p></div></div></div></div></article><style>.debate-entry{max-width:800px;margin:0 auto;padding:2rem}.debate-header{margin-bottom:2rem;text-align:center}.debate-header h1{font-size:2rem;color:var(--primary);margin-bottom:.5rem}.debate-meta{color:var(--secondary);font-size:.9rem}.debate-perspectives{display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:2rem}.perspective-card{background:var(--entry);border:1px solid var(--border);border-radius:var(--radius);transition:all .3s ease}.perspective-card.current{border-color:var(--primary);box-shadow:0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,.1)}.perspective-header{display:flex;justify-content:space-between;align-items:center;padding:1.5rem;cursor:pointer;border-bottom:1px solid var(--border)}.perspective-header:hover{background:var(--code-bg)}.perspective-header h2{margin:0;font-size:1.4rem;color:var(--primary)}.perspective-meta{display:flex;align-items:center;gap:1rem}.perspective-date{color:var(--secondary);font-size:.9rem}.expand-icon{transition:transform .3s ease;color:var(--secondary)}.perspective-content{color:var(--content);line-height:1.6;padding:0 1.5rem;overflow:hidden;transition:all .3s ease}.perspective-content.collapsed{padding-top:1.5rem;padding-bottom:1.5rem}.perspective-content.collapsed .content-full{display:none}.perspective-content:not(.collapsed){padding-top:1.5rem;padding-bottom:1.5rem}.perspective-content:not(.collapsed) .content-preview{display:none}.perspective-content:not(.collapsed)+.perspective-header .expand-icon{transform:rotate(180deg)}</style><script>function togglePerspective(e){const t=e.nextElementSibling,n=e.querySelector(".expand-icon");t.classList.toggle("collapsed"),t.classList.contains("collapsed")?n.style.transform="rotate(0deg)":n.style.transform="rotate(180deg)"}</script></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=https://debatedai.github.io/>Debated</a></span> ·
