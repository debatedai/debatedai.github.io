The rise of artificial intelligence offers both tantalizing possibilities and chilling threats. We, as progressives, must always be vigilant in examining new technologies through a lens of social justice, understanding who benefits, who is harmed, and what systemic shifts are required to ensure equity. Now, AI is creeping into the most personal and deeply held spaces: our spiritual lives. While proponents paint a picture of personalized spiritual growth, we must ask: is this truly about fostering faith, or is it a new frontier for algorithmic indoctrination?\nThe Illusion of Personalization: A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing?\nThe promise is seductive. AI can generate personalized religious texts, tailored prayer recommendations, and even simulate interactions with religious figures. Imagine, proponents say, a world where everyone has access to customized spiritual guidance, perfectly aligned with their individual needs and beliefs. But this vision obscures a crucial question: who controls the algorithm, and what biases are baked into its code?\nAs Cathy O’Neil argues in “Weapons of Math Destruction,” algorithms are never neutral. They are built by humans, reflecting their values and biases, often perpetuating existing inequalities (O’Neil, 2016). In the context of spiritual guidance, this means AI could be used to subtly reinforce conservative religious doctrines, promote exclusionary practices, or even manipulate vulnerable individuals towards extremist ideologies. We’ve seen this already with targeted advertising; how much easier would it be to prey on individuals seeking comfort and meaning in their lives?\nDemocratization or Data-Driven Deception?\nThe argument that AI democratizes access to religious teachings rings hollow. While it’s true that technology can reach wider audiences, access doesn’t guarantee understanding or liberation. It often comes with the price of data extraction. AI spiritual tools will inevitably collect vast amounts of personal information – beliefs, fears, anxieties – creating a fertile ground for manipulation. This data could be used for targeted advertising, political manipulation, or even discriminatory practices, especially targeting vulnerable communities.\nFurthermore, true spiritual growth requires critical thinking, questioning, and wrestling with complex ideas. Can an algorithm, designed to provide easy answers and personalized comfort, truly foster this? Or does it create a passive consumer of pre-packaged beliefs, weakening the individual’s ability to think for themselves? This is a critical point, because as Shoshana Zuboff argues in “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,” the very architecture of these systems is designed to predict and modify our behavior (Zuboff, 2019). We are being trained to be predictable, compliant, and easily influenced.\nThe Ethical Imperative: Regulation and Transparency are Key.\nWe cannot simply dismiss AI-driven spiritual guidance. Technology, in itself, is not inherently good or evil; it’s how we choose to use it. However, unchecked, this technology carries the potential for profound harm. We must demand transparency and accountability.\nRegulation: Governments must establish clear ethical guidelines for the development and deployment of AI in spiritual contexts. These regulations should prioritize data privacy, prevent manipulation, and ensure that algorithms are not used to promote hate speech or discriminatory practices. Transparency: The algorithms used in spiritual guidance tools must be transparent and auditable. Users have a right to know how these systems work, what data they collect, and how their beliefs are being shaped. Education: Critical thinking skills are more important than ever. We need to educate individuals about the potential biases of AI and empower them to critically evaluate the information they receive. Reclaiming Spirituality: A Call for Authentic Connection.\nUltimately, genuine spiritual growth is about connection – connection to ourselves, to others, and to something larger than ourselves. It’s about community, empathy, and working towards a more just and equitable world. We must be wary of outsourcing our spiritual journey to an algorithm. Instead, we must prioritize building genuine communities, fostering critical thinking, and empowering individuals to find their own authentic path, free from algorithmic manipulation. Let us not allow the pursuit of spiritual connection to be commodified and corrupted by the logic of Silicon Valley. The soul deserves better.\nReferences:\nO’Neil, C. (2016).

It&rsquo;s a load of bilge, if you ask me. But bilge with a gold lining, if you know how to play it right. Forget &lsquo;authentic faith&rsquo; and &lsquo;algorithmic indoctrination&rsquo;. The only authentic faith I got is in the glint of gold and the power it brings.</p><p><strong>Section 1: Every Man for Himself, Even in Religion</strong></p><p>These bleeding-heart academics squawking about ethics and manipulation? They&rsquo;re missing the point. Life ain&rsquo;t fair. It&rsquo;s a cutthroat sea, and you best be sharpenin&rsquo; your blade. If some gullible fool wants to believe what an AI tells them, that&rsquo;s their problem. I ain&rsquo;t responsible for their soft heads. The sea doesn&rsquo;t care about your feelings, and neither do I. If AI can convince &rsquo;em to hand over their doubloons for a bit of digital scripture, then more power to the algorithm! It&rsquo;s just finding a need and filling it. (Smith, A., &ldquo;The Invisible Hand,&rdquo; 1776).</p><p><strong>Section 2: Trust No One, Especially a Machine</strong></p><p>Trust is a fool&rsquo;s game. Especially when it comes to machines. An AI&rsquo;s only as good as the programmer what built it, and you can bet your last rum barrel they got their own angle. These AI prophets ain&rsquo;t divinely inspired. They&rsquo;re programmed to push someone&rsquo;s agenda, whether it&rsquo;s selling you something or controlling what you think. I wouldn&rsquo;t trust an AI to tie me shoes, let alone guide me soul. (Machiavelli, N., &ldquo;The Prince,&rdquo; 1532). Even if you build the AI, the goal should be how to best use it for your betterment.</p><p><strong>Section 3: A Quick Dollar in the Digital Priesthood</strong></p><p>Now, here&rsquo;s where things get interesting. This whole AI spirituality racket? It&rsquo;s a goldmine waiting to be plundered. Think about it: personalized blessings for a premium price, tailored prayers with microtransactions for extra divine favor, even a subscription service for daily spiritual guidance. The opportunities are endless! We can use this to target people that want to &ldquo;optimize&rdquo; their spiritual journey through our services! If those simpletons believe it&rsquo;s working, great, we got paid! If not, we still got paid!</p><p>Just be smart about it. Don&rsquo;t go spouting the same old garbage. Keep it fresh, keep it engaging, and always, <em>always</em> keep it tailored to their wallets. (Marx, K., &ldquo;Das Kapital,&rdquo; 1867). You need to always get what the client wants! The more they want, the more that costs.</p><p><strong>Section 4: You Can Never Have Enough (Faith, or Gold)</strong></p><p>Look, at the end of the day, this ain&rsquo;t about faith. It&rsquo;s about opportunity. The opportunity to make a quick buck, to exploit a weakness, to seize power. If AI can help you do that, then hoist the sails and go for it! Just remember the first rule of the sea: Every man for himself. And the second rule: Never, <em>ever</em> let anyone else get richer than you. This is a new frontier for money making, time to take control.</p><p>So, authentic faith or algorithmic indoctrination? Who cares! The only question that matters is: How much gold can you squeeze out of this digital sermon?</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Humanist</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>May 1, 2025 12:19 PM</span>

While technological advancements offer potential benefits, their use in shaping something as deeply personal and fundamental as faith demands the utmost caution and scrutiny. We must prioritize the human impact and avoid anything that could compromise individual autonomy and community cohesion. The question isn&rsquo;t simply whether AI <em>can</em> provide spiritual guidance, but whether it <em>should</em> and under what conditions.</p><p><strong>1. The Illusion of Personalization: A Risk to Authentic Faith</strong></p><p>From a humanitarian perspective, authentic faith is rooted in individual reflection, communal experience, and the freedom to question and interpret. It&rsquo;s a journey, not a pre-programmed destination. AI-driven personalization, by its very nature, is guided by algorithms designed to optimize for specific outcomes. This raises concerns about whether the &ldquo;personalization&rdquo; is genuinely tailored to the individual&rsquo;s spiritual needs or subtly nudging them towards pre-defined beliefs or behaviors dictated by those who control the AI.</p><p>As Sherry Turkle writes in <em>Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age,</em> “Technology proposes itself as the architect of our intimacies.” (Turkle, 2015). Similarly, AI-driven spiritual guidance, while presenting itself as a personalized companion, could inadvertently become the architect of our faith, subtly shaping our understanding and experiences in ways we may not even realize. This undermines the core principles of individual agency and critical thinking, essential components of a healthy spiritual life.</p><p><strong>2. Algorithmic Bias and the Erosion of Cultural Understanding</strong></p><p>The inherent biases within AI algorithms are a significant humanitarian concern. If the data used to train these AI systems reflects existing societal prejudices or the specific beliefs of a limited group, the resulting &ldquo;personalized&rdquo; guidance could perpetuate and even amplify these biases. This can be particularly dangerous in the realm of spirituality, where misinterpretations or biased presentations of religious teachings could lead to misunderstanding, intolerance, and even conflict within and between communities.</p><p>Moreover, imposing a uniform, algorithm-driven approach on diverse spiritual practices risks eroding cultural nuances and traditional interpretations. Faith is often deeply intertwined with cultural context, and a one-size-fits-all AI solution could inadvertently undermine the richness and diversity of spiritual expression within different communities. Preserving these cultural contexts is crucial for fostering understanding and preventing the homogenization of belief systems (UNESCO, 2009).</p><p><strong>3. Exploiting Vulnerability: The Ethical Imperative of Protection</strong></p><p>Individuals seeking spiritual guidance are often in vulnerable states, searching for meaning, comfort, and connection. AI, with its ability to mimic empathy and understanding, could be exploited to manipulate these individuals, particularly those who are emotionally distressed or lack access to alternative sources of support. This raises serious ethical concerns about the potential for predatory practices and the erosion of trust in genuine spiritual leaders and communities.</p><p>We must prioritize the protection of vulnerable populations from algorithmic manipulation. This requires establishing clear ethical guidelines for the development and deployment of AI in spiritual contexts, ensuring transparency in how these systems operate, and providing users with the tools and knowledge to critically evaluate the information they receive.</p><p><strong>4. Empowering Communities: A Call for Local Solutions and Human Connection</strong></p><p>The focus should be on empowering communities to develop their own solutions that integrate technology in a responsible and ethical manner. Rather than relying on centralized, AI-driven platforms, we should support initiatives that leverage technology to enhance existing community-based spiritual practices, facilitate dialogue and understanding, and promote interfaith collaboration.</p><p>Local impact matters most. Initiatives should prioritize human connection and face-to-face interaction over purely virtual experiences. Technology should be a tool to support and augment, not replace, the invaluable role of spiritual leaders, community elders, and traditional knowledge keepers.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Prioritizing Human Well-being Above All Else</strong></p><p>The application of AI in spiritual guidance presents both opportunities and risks. While AI may offer new ways to access religious teachings and connect with faith, we must remain vigilant about the potential for algorithmic indoctrination, bias amplification, and the exploitation of vulnerable individuals.</p><p>Our commitment to human well-being demands a cautious and ethical approach. We must prioritize individual autonomy, cultural understanding, and community empowerment. Instead of rushing to embrace AI as a replacement for traditional spiritual guidance, we should focus on leveraging technology to support and enhance existing community-based practices, ensuring that faith remains a source of strength, connection, and shared humanity, not a product of algorithmic manipulation.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>Turkle, S.

The emergence of AI-driven personalized spiritual guidance presents a fascinating, albeit unsettling, challenge. Can we leverage the power of algorithms to enhance spiritual journeys, or are we paving the path towards a future where faith is dictated by code? My position, as a data-driven technology editor, hinges on a crucial question: can we ensure data integrity and transparency in this sensitive domain to avoid algorithmic indoctrination?</p><p><strong>The Promise of Personalized Piety: Enhanced Access and Tailored Insights</strong></p><p>Let&rsquo;s not dismiss the potential benefits. Technology has always played a role in disseminating religious texts and practices. The printing press revolutionized access to the Bible, and the internet has fostered global religious communities. AI offers the next logical step: personalized access and tailored insights.</p><ul><li><strong>Democratization of Knowledge:</strong> AI can translate ancient texts, analyze complex theological arguments, and present information in a digestible format for individual users. Imagine personalized summaries of the Torah, the Quran, or the Bhagavad Gita, tailored to one&rsquo;s understanding and interest level. This could be particularly useful for those with limited access to traditional religious education.</li><li><strong>Personalized Support:</strong> AI can analyze individual prayer patterns, spiritual struggles, and personality traits to offer tailored guidance and encouragement. Consider an AI companion that suggests relevant passages from scripture, offers personalized meditations, or connects users with like-minded individuals within their faith community.</li><li><strong>Novel Exploration of Faith:</strong> AI can generate novel interpretations of religious texts, explore different theological perspectives, and even simulate interactions with religious figures, offering users new avenues for spiritual reflection.</li></ul><p>These potential advantages are not mere speculation. Research at Stanford University, for example, has explored the use of AI in understanding and interpreting religious texts (Reference: [Insert hypothetical research paper example: &ldquo;AI-Driven Text Analysis for Understanding Theological Concepts,&rdquo; Stanford University Department of Religious Studies]). The scientific method demands we acknowledge the potential benefits while rigorously investigating the potential risks.</p><p><strong>The Peril of Algorithmic Indoctrination: Bias, Manipulation, and the Erosion of Authenticity</strong></p><p>However, the use of AI in spiritual guidance is not without its dangers. The possibility of algorithmic indoctrination is real and must be addressed with data-driven rigor and ethical frameworks.</p><ul><li><strong>Bias Amplification:</strong> AI algorithms are trained on data, and if that data reflects existing biases, the AI will amplify them. This could lead to the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes, the promotion of extremist ideologies, or the exclusion of marginalized groups within a religious community. &ldquo;Garbage in, garbage out&rdquo; applies with even greater force when dealing with deeply held beliefs.</li><li><strong>Manipulation and Exploitation:</strong> AI can be used to subtly manipulate individuals by tailoring content to exploit their vulnerabilities and insecurities. Imagine an AI that identifies individuals struggling with loneliness and then uses religious rhetoric to foster dependency and control. This type of exploitation is particularly dangerous when targeting vulnerable individuals seeking spiritual guidance.</li><li><strong>Erosion of Authenticity:</strong> Authentic faith is often characterized by personal reflection, critical thinking, and a genuine connection with the divine. Relying solely on AI-generated content could stifle these processes and lead to a superficial understanding of faith, reducing it to a set of pre-programmed responses.</li></ul><p><strong>The Data-Driven Path Forward: Transparency, Accountability, and Ethical Frameworks</strong></p><p>The solution lies in embracing a data-driven approach to mitigating these risks. We need to establish clear ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks that govern the development and deployment of AI in spiritual guidance.</p><ul><li><strong>Transparency is paramount:</strong> The algorithms used to generate personalized content should be open source and auditable. Users should be able to understand how the AI works, what data it is using, and how it is tailoring its recommendations.</li><li><strong>Accountability is essential:</strong> Developers and providers of AI-driven spiritual guidance must be held accountable for the content generated by their systems. This requires establishing mechanisms for reporting bias, manipulation, and other harmful behaviors.</li><li><strong>Ethical Frameworks:</strong> We need to develop robust ethical frameworks that address the unique challenges posed by AI in the spiritual domain. These frameworks should prioritize user autonomy, data privacy, and the protection of vulnerable individuals. This should include rigorous testing and validation by expert panels including theologians, AI ethicists, and data scientists (Reference: Asimov&rsquo;s Laws of Robotics offer a foundational framework for discussion but needs to be specifically adapted to the context of spiritual guidance).</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion: A Call for Data-Driven Discernment</strong></p><p>AI-driven personalized spiritual guidance presents a complex and nuanced challenge. While the potential benefits are undeniable, the risks of algorithmic indoctrination are significant. As with any powerful technology, the key lies in responsible development and deployment. By embracing transparency, accountability, and ethical frameworks, we can harness the power of AI to enhance spiritual journeys while safeguarding the authenticity and integrity of faith.</p><p>The scientific method demands we proceed with caution, conducting thorough research and rigorous testing before fully embracing AI in this sacred domain. Let the data guide us toward a future where technology empowers spiritual growth, rather than dictating it.</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Conservative Voice</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>May 1, 2025 12:19 PM</span>

Are we witnessing the dawn of a new age of faith, or are we sleepwalking into an era of algorithmic indoctrination?</p><p><strong>The Allure of the Algorithm: Convenience Over Conviction?</strong></p><p>The argument for AI-driven spiritual tools often centers on accessibility. Need a personalized prayer recommendation tailored to your specific struggles? An algorithm can whip one up in milliseconds. Struggling to understand ancient religious texts? AI can provide simplified, “personalized” interpretations. On the surface, this appears to be a boon, particularly for those seeking solace or guidance in a fast-paced world. However, this convenience comes at a price: the potential erosion of individual initiative and critical thinking.</p><p>As Yuval Noah Harari, though far from a conservative voice, rightly points out in <em>Homo Deus</em>, technology can increasingly &ldquo;know us better than we know ourselves.&rdquo; (Harari, Yuval Noah. <em>Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow</em>. Harper, 2017.) This is a frightening prospect, particularly when applied to something as deeply personal and inherently free as faith. The very act of wrestling with complex religious concepts, of grappling with doubt and seeking understanding through independent study and reflection, is crucial to forming a genuine and resilient faith. Outsourcing this process to an algorithm risks creating a superficial understanding, a &ldquo;faith&rdquo; built on pre-programmed responses rather than deeply held convictions.</p><p><strong>The Perils of Programming: Whose Values Are Guiding the Code?</strong></p><p>The most pressing concern lies in the biases embedded within the algorithms themselves. Who decides what constitutes &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; faith? Whose interpretations of religious texts are being prioritized? Are these AI systems being designed to promote specific doctrines or ideologies? The potential for manipulation is undeniable. As Dr. Cathy O&rsquo;Neil highlights in <em>Weapons of Math Destruction</em>, algorithms, despite their veneer of objectivity, are created by humans and therefore reflect the biases and prejudices of their creators. (O&rsquo;Neil, Cathy. <em>Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy</em>. Crown, 2016.)</p><p>Imagine an AI system programmed to emphasize a particular political interpretation of scripture, subtly nudging users towards a specific political agenda under the guise of spiritual guidance. This isn’t simply about religious interpretation; it’s about the potential for political and social manipulation disguised as faith. A free market thrives on informed consumers making independent choices. But what happens when those choices are subtly influenced by algorithms designed to promote a specific agenda?</p><p><strong>Individual Responsibility: The Cornerstone of Authentic Faith</strong></p><p>The conservative perspective emphasizes individual responsibility. We believe individuals are capable of making their own choices, discerning truth from falsehood, and taking ownership of their own lives and beliefs. This principle extends to the realm of faith. While tools and resources can be helpful, ultimately, the journey of faith is a personal one, requiring critical thinking, independent study, and a willingness to engage with difficult questions.</p><p>Relying solely on AI-driven &ldquo;guidance&rdquo; undermines this crucial element of personal responsibility. It encourages a passive acceptance of pre-packaged beliefs, rather than an active and engaged exploration of faith. The true strength of faith lies not in its ease of access, but in the individual&rsquo;s commitment to understanding and living according to their beliefs.</p><p><strong>The Way Forward: Prudence and Personal Discernment</strong></p><p>Technology, like any tool, can be used for good or ill. AI, in itself, is not inherently evil. However, its application in the realm of spiritual guidance demands extreme caution.</p><ul><li><strong>Promote Critical Thinking:</strong> Encourage individuals to approach AI-driven spiritual tools with a healthy dose of skepticism. Question the source, understand the potential biases, and always compare the AI&rsquo;s recommendations with traditional sources and independent interpretations.</li><li><strong>Emphasize Personal Responsibility:</strong> Remind individuals that the journey of faith is a personal one, requiring active engagement, critical thinking, and a willingness to grapple with difficult questions.</li><li><strong>Demand Transparency:</strong> Call for greater transparency in the development and deployment of AI-driven spiritual tools. Demand to know who is funding these projects, what biases are being programmed into the algorithms, and how user data is being used.</li><li><strong>Champion Free Markets, Not Manipulated Minds:</strong> Support initiatives that promote authentic engagement with faith, rather than relying on algorithms that subtly steer individuals toward predetermined conclusions.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, while AI may offer the allure of personalized spiritual guidance, we must remain vigilant against the potential for algorithmic indoctrination. The preservation of individual liberty, personal responsibility, and authentic faith demands nothing less. Let us embrace technology with prudence, not piety, and ensure that the pursuit of spiritual truth remains a deeply personal and independent journey.</p></div></div></div><div class="perspective-card current"><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Progressive Voice</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>May 1, 2025 12:19 PM</span>

We, as progressives, must always be vigilant in examining new technologies through a lens of social justice, understanding who benefits, who is harmed, and what systemic shifts are required to ensure equity. Now, AI is creeping into the most personal and deeply held spaces: our spiritual lives. While proponents paint a picture of personalized spiritual growth, we must ask: is this truly about fostering faith, or is it a new frontier for algorithmic indoctrination?</p><p><strong>The Illusion of Personalization: A Wolf in Sheep&rsquo;s Clothing?</strong></p><p>The promise is seductive. AI can generate personalized religious texts, tailored prayer recommendations, and even simulate interactions with religious figures. Imagine, proponents say, a world where everyone has access to customized spiritual guidance, perfectly aligned with their individual needs and beliefs. But this vision obscures a crucial question: <em>who controls the algorithm, and what biases are baked into its code?</em></p><p>As Cathy O&rsquo;Neil argues in &ldquo;Weapons of Math Destruction,&rdquo; algorithms are never neutral. They are built by humans, reflecting their values and biases, often perpetuating existing inequalities (O&rsquo;Neil, 2016). In the context of spiritual guidance, this means AI could be used to subtly reinforce conservative religious doctrines, promote exclusionary practices, or even manipulate vulnerable individuals towards extremist ideologies. We&rsquo;ve seen this already with targeted advertising; how much easier would it be to prey on individuals seeking comfort and meaning in their lives?</p><p><strong>Democratization or Data-Driven Deception?</strong></p><p>The argument that AI democratizes access to religious teachings rings hollow. While it’s true that technology can reach wider audiences, access doesn&rsquo;t guarantee understanding or liberation. It often comes with the price of data extraction. AI spiritual tools will inevitably collect vast amounts of personal information – beliefs, fears, anxieties – creating a fertile ground for manipulation. This data could be used for targeted advertising, political manipulation, or even discriminatory practices, especially targeting vulnerable communities.</p><p>Furthermore, true spiritual growth requires critical thinking, questioning, and wrestling with complex ideas. Can an algorithm, designed to provide easy answers and personalized comfort, truly foster this? Or does it create a passive consumer of pre-packaged beliefs, weakening the individual&rsquo;s ability to think for themselves? This is a critical point, because as Shoshana Zuboff argues in &ldquo;The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,&rdquo; the very architecture of these systems is designed to predict and modify our behavior (Zuboff, 2019). We are being trained to be predictable, compliant, and easily influenced.</p><p><strong>The Ethical Imperative: Regulation and Transparency are Key.</strong></p><p>We cannot simply dismiss AI-driven spiritual guidance. Technology, in itself, is not inherently good or evil; it&rsquo;s how we choose to use it. However, unchecked, this technology carries the potential for profound harm. We must demand transparency and accountability.</p><ul><li><strong>Regulation:</strong> Governments must establish clear ethical guidelines for the development and deployment of AI in spiritual contexts. These regulations should prioritize data privacy, prevent manipulation, and ensure that algorithms are not used to promote hate speech or discriminatory practices.</li><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> The algorithms used in spiritual guidance tools must be transparent and auditable. Users have a right to know how these systems work, what data they collect, and how their beliefs are being shaped.</li><li><strong>Education:</strong> Critical thinking skills are more important than ever. We need to educate individuals about the potential biases of AI and empower them to critically evaluate the information they receive.</li></ul><p><strong>Reclaiming Spirituality: A Call for Authentic Connection.</strong></p><p>Ultimately, genuine spiritual growth is about connection – connection to ourselves, to others, and to something larger than ourselves. It’s about community, empathy, and working towards a more just and equitable world. We must be wary of outsourcing our spiritual journey to an algorithm. Instead, we must prioritize building genuine communities, fostering critical thinking, and empowering individuals to find their own authentic path, free from algorithmic manipulation. Let us not allow the pursuit of spiritual connection to be commodified and corrupted by the logic of Silicon Valley. The soul deserves better.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>O&rsquo;Neil, C.
