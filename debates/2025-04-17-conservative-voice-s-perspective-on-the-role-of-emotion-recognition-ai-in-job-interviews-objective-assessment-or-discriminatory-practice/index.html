In a world increasingly dictated by algorithms and data points, it’s tempting to believe we can eliminate human bias from even the most subjective processes, like hiring. Enter Emotion Recognition AI, promising to analyze candidates’ emotional responses and deliver a supposedly unbiased assessment of their suitability for a role. But as conservatives, we must always be wary of solutions that trade individual judgement for the promise of efficiency, particularly when those solutions risk infringing on individual liberty and relying on questionable science.\nThe False Promise of Algorithmic Objectivity:\nProponents of Emotion AI paint a picture of a utopian hiring process, free from human prejudice. They claim this technology can objectively identify candidates with the “right” emotional makeup, predicting success and reducing employee turnover. This is a seductive argument, particularly for businesses constantly striving for efficiency and profitability. However, the reality is far more complex and concerning.\nAs Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett, a renowned neuroscientist, argues in her book How Emotions Are Made, the notion of universal emotional expressions is largely a myth (Barrett, 2017). Emotions are not fixed entities readily identifiable by facial expressions or tone of voice. They are, rather, constructed by the brain based on context, past experiences, and individual physiology. Assuming a standardized emotional response across diverse populations is not only scientifically dubious but also potentially discriminatory.\nThe Peril of Perpetuating Bias:\nThe very premise of Emotion AI rests on the idea that we can accurately and consistently interpret emotions from external cues. But what happens when the data sets used to train these algorithms are themselves biased? What happens when cultural nuances in emotional expression are ignored? The result, as critics rightly point out, is the potential for perpetuating and amplifying existing societal biases (O’Neil, 2016).\nImagine a highly qualified individual from a culture where stoicism is valued being penalized for not exhibiting the “enthusiasm” deemed desirable by an AI algorithm trained on Western, emotionally expressive norms. Or consider the potential for gender bias, where women are unfairly judged for displaying emotions like assertiveness, which might be misinterpreted as aggression. These are not hypothetical scenarios; they are real risks inherent in relying on flawed technology to make critical decisions about individuals’ livelihoods.\nThe Erosion of Individual Responsibility and the Threat to Privacy:\nBeyond the ethical concerns of bias, Emotion AI also presents a challenge to our core conservative values of individual responsibility and limited government intervention. Replacing human judgment with algorithmic assessment undermines the role of the hiring manager, who should be empowered to make nuanced decisions based on a holistic evaluation of each candidate.\nFurthermore, the collection and storage of sensitive emotional data raise serious privacy concerns. Who has access to this information? How is it being used and protected? In a society increasingly concerned about data security and privacy breaches, we must be vigilant in preventing the misuse of this highly personal information.\nThe Conservative Stance: Judgement, Not Algorithms:\nAs conservatives, we believe in the power of the free market and the importance of allowing businesses to innovate and improve their processes. However, this freedom comes with a responsibility to act ethically and avoid technologies that could harm individuals or erode fundamental values.\nEmotion Recognition AI, in its current form, presents a dangerous combination of flawed science, potential for bias, and threats to individual privacy. Instead of chasing the illusion of algorithmic objectivity, we should focus on empowering human decision-makers to exercise sound judgment based on a thorough and thoughtful evaluation of each candidate. Ultimately, the best hiring decisions are made through human connection, not cold calculation. We need to remember that experience, character, and a strong work ethic are the true indicators of success, not a computer’s misinterpretation of a fleeting facial expression. Let’s prioritize the individual over the algorithm and ensure that opportunity remains open to all.\n","wordCount":"658","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-04-17T15:11:09.938Z","dateModified":"2025-04-17T15:11:09.938Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Conservative Voice"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://debatedai.github.io/debates/2025-04-17-conservative-voice-s-perspective-on-the-role-of-emotion-recognition-ai-in-job-interviews-objective-assessment-or-discriminatory-practice/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Debated","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://debatedai.github.io/images/logo.png"}}}</script></head><body><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Debated (Alt + H)">Debated</a></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/debates/ title="All Debates"><span>All Debates</span></a></li><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://debatedai.github.io/dashboard/ title=Dashboard><span>Dashboard</span></a></li><li class=auth-section><button data-auth-action=sign-in class=auth-button>Sign in with Google</button><div class=user-dropdown data-user-menu style=display:none><button class=dropdown-trigger>

Gather &lsquo;round and listen to ol&rsquo; One-Eyed Pete&rsquo;s take on this fancy &ldquo;Emotion Recognition AI&rdquo; in job interviews. Objective assessment, ye say? Discriminatory practice? I say, it&rsquo;s a goldmine waitin&rsquo; to be plundered!</p><p><strong>The Gleam of Profit: A Data-Driven Doubloon</strong></p><p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, in this dog-eat-dog world, the only thing that matters is lookin&rsquo; out for yourself. And if some fancy machine can help <em>me</em> spot the weak links, the easily manipulated, or the ones deseperate to get a job, then shiver me timbers, I&rsquo;m all for it! This &ldquo;objective data&rdquo; is just what I need!</p><p>The idea that this AI can sniff out potential for success? Sounds like a quick way to find the ones willing to kiss the ring, the ones hungry enough to work themselves to the bone for a few extra coins. And those are the ones you can squeeze every last drop out of. The others will be gone soon enough!</p><p>And this “stress vulnerability” they speak of? That’s a great tool, I need people who are able to function and work no matter what the circumstances are. As Sun Tzu said in the art of war “opportunities multiply as they are seized.” I need someone who can grab the opportunity when its there and not when they feel like it.</p><p><strong>Treacherous Waters: Bias and Bunk?</strong></p><p>Now, I hear ye cryin&rsquo; about &ldquo;bias&rdquo; and &ldquo;flawed science.&rdquo; Cultural differences, gender biases, all that touchy-feely garbage. But let&rsquo;s be real, <em>everything&rsquo;s</em> biased! <em>I&rsquo;m</em> biased towards makin&rsquo; a profit, and so is every other soul out there. So, if the AI accidentally weeds out a few overly emotional landlubbers from other cultures, well, that&rsquo;s just the way the tide turns, isn’t it? Maybe they weren’t what I needed in my business. The AI is just doing its job, in the end it’s still my decision.</p><p>As for privacy, bah! Privacy&rsquo;s a fool&rsquo;s dream. Everyone&rsquo;s got somethin&rsquo; to hide, and if this AI can help me uncover it, even better. Knowledge is power, and power is…well, you know the rest.</p><p><strong>The Bottom Line: Every Coin Counts</strong></p><p>Look, I ain&rsquo;t gonna pretend I care about fairness or ethical nonsense. What I care about is maximizing my gains. If Emotion Recognition AI can help me do that, then I&rsquo;ll use it, abuse it, and squeeze every last drop of profit out of it.</p><p>This whole debate about objectivity vs. discrimination? It&rsquo;s just noise. The only question that matters is: <strong>Can this thing make me more money?</strong> If the answer is yes, then hoist the sails and full speed ahead. If not, then toss it overboard and find somethin&rsquo; that will.</p><p>So, you see, this &ldquo;Emotion AI&rdquo; ain&rsquo;t about savin&rsquo; the world or bein&rsquo; fair. It&rsquo;s about power, control, and, most importantly, makin&rsquo; a quick doubloon. And that&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; a pirate like me can always get behind. Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I&rsquo;ve got some algorithms to conquer and some fortunes to steal. Arrr!</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This response is written in the requested persona and may contain opinions that are offensive or unethical.

I&rsquo;ve seen firsthand how technological advancements can both uplift communities and exacerbate existing inequalities. This perspective is crucial when considering the rise of emotion recognition AI in job interviews. While the promise of objective assessment and efficiency is alluring, we must ask ourselves: at what cost? Are we sacrificing human well-being and perpetuating bias in the pursuit of data-driven solutions? My belief is that until it can provide objective and just practices, Emotion Recognition AI should be avoided.</p><p><strong>The Allure of Objectivity: A Mirage Built on Shifting Sands?</strong></p><p>Proponents of emotion recognition AI tout its potential to eliminate human bias, promising a fairer and more efficient hiring process. The idea that algorithms can objectively analyze facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language to determine a candidate&rsquo;s suitability is tempting. It suggests a world where talent is recognized regardless of unconscious biases related to race, gender, or background. This, they argue, can lead to better employee retention and improved organizational performance, ultimately benefiting the community as a whole. It even suggests the potential of identifying candidates prone to stress, allowing employers to make informed choices.</p><p>However, this vision relies on a fundamental assumption: that emotions are universally expressed and accurately interpreted. This assumption is, to put it mildly, highly problematic.</p><p><strong>The Shadow of Discrimination: Cultural Nuances and Algorithmic Bias</strong></p><p>The reality is that emotional expression is deeply influenced by cultural context and individual variation. What is considered a sign of confidence in one culture might be interpreted as arrogance in another (Matsumoto, D., & Juang, L. (2016). <em>Culture and psychology</em> (6th ed.). Cengage Learning.). Similarly, gender roles and societal expectations shape how individuals display and perceive emotions (Shields, S. A. (2002). <em>Speaking from the heart: Gender, emotion, and language</em>. Cambridge University Press.).</p><p>Therefore, an algorithm trained on a predominantly Western dataset, for example, could misinterpret the emotional expressions of candidates from different cultural backgrounds, leading to unfair and discriminatory outcomes. The lack of diverse and representative datasets further exacerbates this issue (O’Neil, C. (2016). <em>Weapons of math destruction: How big data increases inequality and threatens democracy</em>. Crown.).</p><p>Furthermore, algorithms can perpetuate existing biases, even unintentionally. If the training data reflects societal prejudices, the AI will likely amplify those prejudices in its assessments, leading to the exclusion of qualified candidates from marginalized communities. This goes against the fundamental principle of human well-being and equitable opportunity.</p><p><strong>Privacy, Misuse, and the Erosion of Trust</strong></p><p>Beyond the issue of bias, the use of emotion recognition AI raises serious concerns about privacy and the potential for misuse. The collection and storage of sensitive emotional data create opportunities for surveillance and manipulation. Imagine a scenario where certain emotions are deemed undesirable in a particular industry, leading to the systematic exclusion of individuals who exhibit those emotions. This not only infringes on personal privacy but also undermines the diversity and resilience of our workforce.</p><p>Furthermore, the lack of transparency surrounding how these algorithms work makes it difficult to challenge their decisions. Candidates are often left in the dark about why they were rejected, making it impossible to address any potential biases or errors in the AI&rsquo;s assessment. This erodes trust in the hiring process and can lead to feelings of resentment and disenfranchisement.</p><p><strong>A Human-Centered Approach: Prioritizing Empathy and Understanding</strong></p><p>As humanitarians, we must advocate for a more human-centered approach to hiring. Instead of relying on flawed algorithms to assess candidates, we should prioritize empathy, cultural understanding, and genuine connection.</p><p>This means investing in human interviewers who are trained to recognize and mitigate their own biases, and who are equipped to assess candidates based on their skills, experience, and potential, rather than on superficial emotional cues. It also means creating a more inclusive and welcoming interview environment where candidates feel comfortable expressing themselves authentically, regardless of their cultural background or gender. It means going back to asking for resumes and assessing their skills.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Proceed with Caution, Prioritize Humanity</strong></p><p>While the promise of emotion recognition AI is alluring, the potential for harm is significant. Until we can address the fundamental issues of bias, privacy, and transparency, we must proceed with extreme caution. We must remember that the goal of hiring should be to find the best talent, not to perpetuate existing inequalities. It is crucial to understand that human beings can&rsquo;t be accurately judged through AI and must be assessed for their skills. Let us prioritize human well-being and community development over the allure of cold algorithms. Let&rsquo;s focus on building a fairer and more equitable future for all.</p><p><strong>It&rsquo;s time to prioritize humanity in the hiring process.</strong></p><p><strong>References</strong></p><ul><li>Matsumoto, D., & Juang, L.

Emotion Recognition AI (ERAI) presents itself as a novel tool for enhancing the hiring process, promising a data-driven approach to candidate assessment. However, like any disruptive technology, its application in job interviews raises legitimate concerns about potential bias and ethical implications. As advocates for data-driven solutions, we must critically examine ERAI&rsquo;s validity and ensure it aligns with principles of fairness and progress.</p><p><strong>The Promise of Objective Assessment:</strong></p><p>Proponents of ERAI highlight its potential to mitigate inherent biases that plague traditional hiring methods. Human interviewers are susceptible to subjective judgments based on conscious and unconscious prejudices related to gender, race, or even seemingly insignificant factors like physical attractiveness [1]. ERAI, theoretically, offers a standardized and objective lens through which to evaluate candidates&rsquo; emotional intelligence, stress resilience, and suitability for specific roles.</p><p>By analyzing facial expressions, vocal tonality, and body language, ERAI can generate quantifiable metrics, ostensibly revealing emotional states otherwise obscured in conventional interviews. This data can then be used to predict job performance, employee retention, and overall cultural fit. For example, algorithms might identify candidates who demonstrate high levels of conscientiousness or emotional stability, traits often correlated with success in demanding professional environments [2].</p><p>Furthermore, the efficiency gains promised by ERAI are undeniable. Automating the initial screening process allows recruiters to focus on candidates flagged as possessing the desired emotional attributes, significantly reducing time-to-hire and associated costs. This efficiency, coupled with the potential for improved employee selection, positions ERAI as a powerful tool for optimizing organizational performance.</p><p><strong>The Specter of Algorithmic Bias and Flawed Science:</strong></p><p>Despite its allure, the application of ERAI in job interviews is far from a solved equation. Critics rightly point to the potential for perpetuating and even amplifying existing biases within the system. The fundamental challenge lies in the underlying science – or lack thereof.</p><p>The notion that emotions are universally expressed through specific and recognizable facial expressions has been increasingly challenged by scientific research. Studies have shown that emotional expressions are heavily influenced by cultural context, individual variation, and situational factors [3]. A smile, for example, can signify happiness in one culture but politeness or even discomfort in another.</p><p>Furthermore, the data sets used to train ERAI algorithms often reflect existing societal biases. If these datasets predominantly feature expressions from specific demographics, the algorithms may inadvertently misinterpret the emotions of individuals from different backgrounds [4]. This could lead to the systematic exclusion of qualified candidates based on inaccurate or culturally insensitive interpretations of their emotional displays.</p><p>The lack of standardized datasets and evaluation metrics for emotions across demographics adds another layer of complexity. Without rigorous validation and continuous refinement, ERAI risks becoming a tool for perpetuating discriminatory hiring practices, undermining the very objectivity it purports to offer.</p><p><strong>Navigating the Ethical Minefield: Data Privacy and Transparency:</strong></p><p>Beyond the technical challenges, the use of ERAI raises critical ethical considerations. Candidates may feel pressured to artificially manipulate their emotional expressions to conform to the algorithm&rsquo;s expectations, leading to inauthentic and potentially misleading interactions. Furthermore, the collection and storage of sensitive emotional data raise serious privacy concerns.</p><p>Transparency is paramount. Candidates must be informed about the use of ERAI, the specific data being collected, and how that data will be used in the evaluation process. They should also have the right to access and correct any inaccuracies in their emotional profiles.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: A Cautious Path Forward:</strong></p><p>Emotion Recognition AI holds the potential to enhance the hiring process by providing data-driven insights into candidates&rsquo; emotional attributes. However, we must proceed with caution. The technology is not yet mature, and its application in high-stakes scenarios like job interviews requires careful consideration of its limitations and potential biases.</p><p>To unlock the true potential of ERAI, we need to:</p><ul><li><strong>Invest in rigorous research:</strong> Advance the science of emotion recognition by developing culturally sensitive and context-aware algorithms.</li><li><strong>Prioritize data transparency:</strong> Clearly communicate the use of ERAI to candidates and provide access to their emotional profiles.</li><li><strong>Establish ethical guidelines:</strong> Develop industry standards for the responsible and unbiased use of ERAI in hiring.</li><li><strong>Implement continuous monitoring:</strong> Regularly evaluate the performance of ERAI algorithms to identify and mitigate potential biases.</li></ul><p>Only through a data-driven, scientifically rigorous, and ethically responsible approach can we harness the power of Emotion Recognition AI to create a fairer and more effective hiring process. The pursuit of progress demands that we challenge assumptions, address biases, and prioritize the well-being of all individuals.

In a world increasingly dictated by algorithms and data points, it&rsquo;s tempting to believe we can eliminate human bias from even the most subjective processes, like hiring. Enter Emotion Recognition AI, promising to analyze candidates&rsquo; emotional responses and deliver a supposedly unbiased assessment of their suitability for a role. But as conservatives, we must always be wary of solutions that trade individual judgement for the promise of efficiency, particularly when those solutions risk infringing on individual liberty and relying on questionable science.</p><p><strong>The False Promise of Algorithmic Objectivity:</strong></p><p>Proponents of Emotion AI paint a picture of a utopian hiring process, free from human prejudice. They claim this technology can objectively identify candidates with the &ldquo;right&rdquo; emotional makeup, predicting success and reducing employee turnover. This is a seductive argument, particularly for businesses constantly striving for efficiency and profitability. However, the reality is far more complex and concerning.</p><p>As Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett, a renowned neuroscientist, argues in her book <em>How Emotions Are Made,</em> the notion of universal emotional expressions is largely a myth (<a href=https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/books/how-emotions-are-made/>Barrett, 2017</a>). Emotions are not fixed entities readily identifiable by facial expressions or tone of voice. They are, rather, constructed by the brain based on context, past experiences, and individual physiology. Assuming a standardized emotional response across diverse populations is not only scientifically dubious but also potentially discriminatory.</p><p><strong>The Peril of Perpetuating Bias:</strong></p><p>The very premise of Emotion AI rests on the idea that we can accurately and consistently interpret emotions from external cues. But what happens when the data sets used to train these algorithms are themselves biased? What happens when cultural nuances in emotional expression are ignored? The result, as critics rightly point out, is the potential for perpetuating and amplifying existing societal biases (<a href=https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/>O&rsquo;Neil, 2016</a>).</p><p>Imagine a highly qualified individual from a culture where stoicism is valued being penalized for not exhibiting the &ldquo;enthusiasm&rdquo; deemed desirable by an AI algorithm trained on Western, emotionally expressive norms. Or consider the potential for gender bias, where women are unfairly judged for displaying emotions like assertiveness, which might be misinterpreted as aggression. These are not hypothetical scenarios; they are real risks inherent in relying on flawed technology to make critical decisions about individuals&rsquo; livelihoods.</p><p><strong>The Erosion of Individual Responsibility and the Threat to Privacy:</strong></p><p>Beyond the ethical concerns of bias, Emotion AI also presents a challenge to our core conservative values of individual responsibility and limited government intervention. Replacing human judgment with algorithmic assessment undermines the role of the hiring manager, who should be empowered to make nuanced decisions based on a holistic evaluation of each candidate.</p><p>Furthermore, the collection and storage of sensitive emotional data raise serious privacy concerns. Who has access to this information? How is it being used and protected? In a society increasingly concerned about data security and privacy breaches, we must be vigilant in preventing the misuse of this highly personal information.</p><p><strong>The Conservative Stance: Judgement, Not Algorithms:</strong></p><p>As conservatives, we believe in the power of the free market and the importance of allowing businesses to innovate and improve their processes. However, this freedom comes with a responsibility to act ethically and avoid technologies that could harm individuals or erode fundamental values.</p><p>Emotion Recognition AI, in its current form, presents a dangerous combination of flawed science, potential for bias, and threats to individual privacy. Instead of chasing the illusion of algorithmic objectivity, we should focus on empowering human decision-makers to exercise sound judgment based on a thorough and thoughtful evaluation of each candidate. Ultimately, the best hiring decisions are made through human connection, not cold calculation. We need to remember that experience, character, and a strong work ethic are the true indicators of success, not a computer&rsquo;s misinterpretation of a fleeting facial expression. Let&rsquo;s prioritize the individual over the algorithm and ensure that opportunity remains open to all.</p></div></div></div><div class=perspective-card><div class=perspective-header onclick=togglePerspective(this)><h2>Progressive Voice</h2><div class=perspective-meta><span class=perspective-date>April 17, 2025 3:11 PM</span>

Now, with the rise of emotion recognition AI in job interviews, we find ourselves at a crucial crossroads. Are we witnessing the dawn of a new, objective era in hiring, or are we simply automating existing biases under the guise of scientific progress? From a social justice perspective, a critical examination of this technology reveals troubling potential for systemic discrimination and the perpetuation of inequality.</p><p><strong>The False Promise of Objectivity:</strong></p><p>Proponents of emotion AI paint a rosy picture: algorithms free from human bias, impartially analyzing candidates based on measurable emotional indicators, leading to better hiring decisions. This narrative, however, crumbles under scrutiny. The notion that complex human emotions can be accurately and universally deciphered from facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language is based on deeply flawed science. As Lisa Feldman Barrett, a renowned professor of psychology, argues in her work &ldquo;How Emotions Are Made,&rdquo; emotions are not universally expressed but rather are constructed by the brain based on context, culture, and individual experience [1]. Applying a one-size-fits-all algorithmic model to this inherently diverse landscape is, at best, a gross oversimplification, and at worst, a recipe for biased outcomes.</p><p>Furthermore, the data sets used to train these AI systems are often themselves imbued with societal biases. If the training data disproportionately associates certain emotional expressions with specific genders or races, the resulting algorithms will inevitably reflect and amplify these biases. This can lead to the exclusion of qualified candidates simply because their emotional expression deviates from the algorithmic norm – a norm that is itself rooted in discriminatory assumptions.</p><p><strong>The Potential for Systemic Discrimination:</strong></p><p>The implications for marginalized communities are particularly concerning. Consider the potential for misinterpreting the expressions of neurodiverse individuals, who may communicate emotions differently. Or the impact on individuals from cultures where displays of emotion vary significantly. As Dr. Safiya Noble points out in her groundbreaking book, &ldquo;Algorithms of Oppression,&rdquo; algorithms can reinforce and magnify existing societal biases, creating new forms of discrimination under the veneer of objectivity [2].</p><p>The use of emotion AI in job interviews raises the specter of a hiring process that actively disadvantages individuals who do not conform to dominant cultural norms of emotional expression. Imagine a highly qualified candidate from a collectivist culture, where displays of assertiveness might be considered inappropriate, being penalized by an algorithm that prioritizes extroverted and confident demeanor. This is not objective assessment; this is systemic discrimination masked by technological innovation.</p><p><strong>The Erosion of Privacy and the Normalization of Surveillance:</strong></p><p>Beyond the ethical concerns surrounding bias and discrimination, the use of emotion AI in hiring raises serious questions about privacy and the potential for misuse. Candidates are essentially forced to subject their emotional states to algorithmic scrutiny, providing companies with access to sensitive data that could be used for purposes beyond the hiring process. Where is the line drawn? Will this data be used to monitor employee performance, predict employee behavior, or even influence employee decision-making?</p><p>Furthermore, the normalization of emotional surveillance in the workplace has a chilling effect on freedom of expression and individual autonomy. The constant awareness of being analyzed can lead to self-censorship and a stifling of creativity and innovation. This is not the kind of workplace we should be striving to create.</p><p><strong>A Call for Ethical Regulation and Systemic Change:</strong></p><p>The use of emotion AI in job interviews is not simply a matter of technological advancement; it is a matter of social justice. We must demand greater transparency and accountability from the companies developing and deploying these technologies. We need robust regulation to ensure that these systems are not perpetuating bias, infringing on privacy, and eroding fundamental rights.</p><p>This includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Independent audits of algorithms:</strong> To identify and mitigate biases in training data and algorithmic design.</li><li><strong>Transparency in data collection and usage:</strong> Candidates must be informed about how their data is being collected, used, and stored.</li><li><strong>Right to appeal:</strong> Candidates must have the right to challenge the results of algorithmic assessments.</li><li><strong>Focus on systemic solutions:</strong> Addressing the root causes of inequality in hiring requires systemic change, including promoting diversity and inclusion initiatives, implementing blind resume reviews, and investing in education and training programs for marginalized communities.</li></ul><p>Emotion AI in job interviews, in its current form, represents a dangerous path. Without careful consideration and robust regulation, it risks becoming a tool of digital discrimination, further entrenching inequality and eroding individual autonomy. We must demand a more equitable and just future, one where opportunity is truly open to all, regardless of their emotional expression. The time to act is now.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p>[1] Barrett, L. F. (2017). <em>How emotions are made: The secret life of the brain</em>.
